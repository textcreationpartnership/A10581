            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But becauſe we are ſubiect to many eny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, croſſes, and temptations, and ſo haue neede of comfort: and becauſe alſo, when we both haue, heare, and reade of comfort,<note place="margin">Iohn. 20.25</note> we be as Thomas was, hard receauers of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: I thinke it needefull, that for the better obtayning of comfort, we vſe two thinges in the reading of good bookes, and the holy

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Math. 21.22.</note>The firſt is that before we read, we pray. For as of ourſelues we are, &amp; haue nothing: ſo to faythfull prayers, is made a promiſe of all thinges. The ſecond is that in all our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate reading we apply y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde to our ſelues &amp; take that which is there ſpoken, and reade to be ſpoken to vs, or him that readeth it: for els ſhall we neither haue our lyues mended, nor our ſoules comforted by the worde, and then the word, leeſeth his fruitfull effect. But if when wee ſee, and heare, Ephraim, Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; Iuda, or the ſcribes, &amp; phariſes threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened, &amp; reproued for their ſinnes, we will in place of them, put in our owne ſelues, and names, and know it to be ſpoken to vs (as it is in deed if we be lyke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Ieremy. 5.9</note>) then no doubt we ſhall read to our amendement.

<pb facs="tcp:16253:6"/>
remoued, and our heauy hartes ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted.</p>
            <p>And here I will paſſe ouer the iuſt prayſes which this booke deſerueth, both in excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of the matter, as god hath geuen it, &amp; in lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dablenes of the maner as <hi>Vrbane</hi> hath ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it.

But now to returne where I began I beſeech you hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and worſhipfull Citizens, that as you haue heard my dedication was not without cauſe: ſo now ye will graunt me a petition, or two which doe not exceede reaſon. The firſt is that (God hauing his dew prayſe for all his goodnes) ye would both pardon this my bouldnes, and alſo vouchſafe my ſimple la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors (about the heauenly worde) no worſe entertainement, and protection, then ye vſe to ſhew to your earthly peuples.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongſt all ſortes of ſtudies, and labors belonging to the lyfe of man, as there is none comparable to the ſearching of holy ſcriptures: ſo in reading thereof di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent regard ought to be had. Firſt with what minde, and to what end a man rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them. Secondly in what ſence, and after what meaning he vnderſtandeth them. Touching the firſt, as the ſcriptures, and word of God of his nature is holy: ſo is it requiſite no man to reſort thereunto, otherwiſe then with an holy minde: nor to read them, but to a bleſſed purpoſe. That is, to profite in a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall intelligence: to learne the true will, and worſhippe of God in his word: to encreaſe in fayth: and to ſearch out the kingdome of lyfe.</p>
            <p>This done, the ſecond conſideration is to be had, for the true ſence, and right vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of the ſame. Some there be, and that not a few, who entering the ſtudye of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ſcriptures, haue not all peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture the right meaning of the holy ghoſt therein conteined. The good Enuch in the Actes of the Apoſtles, was well occupied in his kouche, reading the propheticall ſcriptures, yet he vnderſtode not what he red, before an expoſitor was ſent him. Thapoſtles themſelues had the ſcriptures, and red them: yet how farre from the meaning thereof were they, before their ſenſes were opened? So the Iewes, and Saracens to this day doe haunt the ſcriptures, but for lacke of trew vnderſtanding, in what blindenes do they yet remaine? They which in reading the miſticall ſcriptures, do ſee nothing els but the literall ſence, and outward hiſtory therof, though they thinke to ſee ſomething, yet in very deed ſee nothing. Albeit I denay not, but in the externe letter, and hiſtorye of the ould teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there is a certen veritie of thinges ſo doon, as in the letter is ſpecified: yet vnder the ſame letter, and hiſtoricall truth, lyeth an other more ſecret, and miſticall truth, which muſt be opened. For as the ſcriptures of the former teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were written moſt by the prophets, ſo haue they
<pb facs="tcp:16253:8"/>
no doubt, a propheticall meaning. And as all the ſcriptures were inſpired by the holy ſpirite of God, ſo carye they a ſpirituall vnderſtanding ſecretly couered vnder the viſible letter.</p>
            <p>As for example the eating of the Apple, and caſting out of paradiſe: the ſlaughter of Abell, by his brother Caine: The floud, and Arke of Noah: the promiſed bleſſing in the ſeede of Abraham: The vnknowen generation of Melchiſddech both king, and prieſt: The ſonne of Abraham, geuen, and borne by promiſe, with the inheritaunce caſt vpon him: The whole diſcourſe, &amp; ſtory of Ioſeph: The tipicall lambe, with his bloud ſprinckled, and bones vnbroken: The paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage through the red ſea: The hard rocke guſhing out in water ſpringes: Manna: The braſen ſerpent: The whole courſe and lyfe of Moſes: The land of promiſe: The workes and death of Sampſon: The victorie of Gedeon: The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Dauid: The tabernacle, and temple of Salomon, with the propitiatory, and the Arke: The rapting vp of Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as: The caſting vp of Ionas: Yea the geuing alſo of the lawe it ſelfe, in outward tables, vpon the penticoſte day, that is, fifty dayes after the deliueraunce. Theſe I ſay, with a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſuch other thinges moe, which from time to time, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened amongeſt that people, although in fact, and hiſtorye they beare a truth in deed: yet notwithſtanding, vnder the ſame hiſtoricall truth, as vnder a vaile, or curten lyeth hid other matter of higher miſteries, and greater priuities: which if they be well diſcuſſed, ſhal rapt a mans minde into more perfect knowledge, of ſpirituall contemplation. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as we read, to happen to S. Auſten by hearing Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe expounding the miſeries conteined in the oulde teſtament.</p>
            <p>So that the propheticall Scriptures may well be reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, in a maner, to the perſon of their owne maiſter, that is, to Chriſt himſelfe. Who being here in earth, if a man looke onely vpon his outward ſhape: his humble poore eſtate in this world: his quiet, and ſimple demaynour: his paynefull trauailes, the manifold afflictions, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of his weriſome lyfe: his ſharpe croſſe, and reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full death, and looke no further, he ſhall ſee no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te in him But draw this curtaine of fleſh a little, and with a further inſight vew well what lyeth within, and ther
<pb facs="tcp:16253:9"/>
ſhall appeare an other manner of matter: There ſhalt thou behold the glory of the kingdome of God, the admirable wiſedome, and omnipotent power of the Father, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hell, and the whole world, with all the pride thereof, and the fulnes of the deitie, there corporally dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as S. Paul himſelfe both did ſee, and teſtifie. In much lyke ſort, the ſcriptures writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and inſpired by God, if they be ſought for no further, but for the literall meaning only, or outward precepts of lyfe, they little auaile to ſaluation. But if the miſticall tipes, and manifeſt oracles of the law, Pſalmes, and prophets be thorowly opened, what light, what lyfe, what knowledge geue they? without which I ſee not, how the fayth of a Chriſtian man can ſtand ſound and ſure. And therfore the Lord himſelfe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he would geue fayth to his diſciples, either opened the ſcriptures vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or els opened their eyes, to vnderſtand the ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>And therefore, Doct. <hi>Vrbanus Regius,</hi> thauthor of this treatiſe, is well worthy of thankes, and commendation, for this his labor, in opening to vs ſuch ſcriptures, as the Lord Ieſus appeareth in his talke to haue opened to his two diſciples going to Emaus. And in lyke reſpect, no leſſe commendation alſo is of his part deſerued, and of our part to be recounted, to this our good brother, and learned ſcholemaiſter, Hilton, who at requeſt hath taken paines to tranſlate the ſame, into our engliſh countrye ſpeach, for the better inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſuch, as haue not ben brought vp in the ſkill of the Latine tongue. Accept therefore well in worth gentle reader, the laborious trauaile of this godly man, &amp; read it as the Lord ſhal geue thee time, and leaſure: vpon a more fruitfull matter, thou canſt not employ thy diligence. For when all other thinges ſhall faile thee, onely fayth in Ieſus the Lord, is that muſt ſaue thee, both bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoule. Read and pray. The Lord Ieſus heare thy prayers, and bleſſe thy reading. Amen.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas Doctor Vrbane hath here ſet down, the doctrine which our Sauiour Chriſt taught his diſciples on the way to Emaus, in a dialoge, and not (as it ſemeth) in a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as both in this booke it is called, and in deed it is, (for euery godly dialoge, ſuch as this is, is a ſermon, or rather a great many ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s) think it to be done (beloued reader) for thy profit, &amp; good inſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple. For though this familiar kinde of talking, be not the moſt glorious kinde of oration for the teacher: yet is it the moſt commodious way of inſtruction for the learner. And here behold, how the godly byſhop ſought more thy profit, then his owne prayſe. Agayne it is a good inſample for all, that haue charge of others, thus to inſtruct them, and reaſon with them in diuinitye, and commonly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they haue hard a ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that ſo they may ſee how their younglinges heare, and beare away the ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which they here. But maryed men eſpecially haue in this dialoge a good enſample (as good byſhops of their houſes) to inſtruct their wyues, and to haue ſuch talke with them at home, as may be to the vſe of edifiyng. Then which nothing is more comely, nothing more fruitfull, nothing more neceſſarye.</p>
            <p>For as man, and wife, are the Image of Chriſt, and his ſpirituall church: ſo ought there communication to be of heauenly, and ſpirituall thinges. And they which will vſe this way of domeſticall inſtruction, ſhall reape the fruite thereof, euen to haue their wiues co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forts, not croſſes, and helpers, not hinderers of their godly proceedings: yea they ſhall haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (though they be but women) by this meanes as great defences to their houſes, families, and people, as was Lot to Sodome, as was Phenies to Iſraell, and as Moſes was to the Iewes, when he ſtode in the gappe, and tourned away the wrath of the Lord. But women children, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarily vſed, do ſhew contrary fruites, and worke contrary effects. And here if any aduerſarye of the goſpell, hold that ſuch hye matters, would not be handled in ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:16253:10"/>
homely dialogs with women, ſend them to the example of Chriſt in the goſpell, and the apoſtles in the Acts, who are Vrbans warrant in this matter. And if they require exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of doctors they ſhall finde that Hilarius in his booke to his daughter Aphra, Ambroſe to his ſiſter, Hierom to Principia, Hedibia, Algaſia, Euſtachius, and Paula, and Saint Auguſtine to his mother, haue all vſed the lyke participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hye miſteries with women as Vrbane hath here done in this dialoge. And therfore can it not be ſayd, but that this manner of teaching is godly, profita<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble, and vſual. Wherefore receaue it, reade it, and pray beloued reader, that thou mayſt profite in it, to Gods glorye, and thy ſaluation.</p>

            <head>¶ A Dialogue of Vrbanus <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius, vpon the Sermon which Chriſt</hi> made out of Moyſes, &amp; the Prophets, to thoſe two his Diſciples, as they went from <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maus,</hi> immediatly after his Reſurrection, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the propheſies of the old Teſtament concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Chriſt: are godly, and plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</head>

What trobleth your mind? Why doe you ſigh ſo often? Do you not know that Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſus Sirach willeth vs to pluck vp our harts in holines, and to driue al heuynes away from vs?<note n="A" place="margin">Ieſus Sy. 30.23.</note>

               <p>I know it wel, but ſorrow, and ſadnes are not both of one kind, neither be our mindes alwayes penſiue vpon one, and the ſame occaſion. Doth not the ſame Paul alſo ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is <hi>a godly ſorow,</hi> or heuines, <hi>which cauſeth repentance vnto ſaluation, not to be repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of: &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarily a worldly ſorrow, which cauſeth death?</hi>

               <p>You ſay well in deed. But what is the matter (I pray you) that you are ſo full of heuines? What is it that trobleth you thus?</p>

               <speaker>¶Anna.</speaker>
               <p>What was it that trobled, and vexed thoſe two Diſciples, <hi>Cleophas,</hi> and his companyon, as they went to Emaus?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Vrbanus.</speaker>
               <p>O, they had very great cauſes to be ſad. For as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, their harts were al blinded with the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb facs="tcp:16253:12"/>
of ignorance, and their faith was litle, and ſlender, and they had not a ſufficient, and perfect knowledge of Chriſt, although they had now a long time profeſſed themſelues to be his Diſciples.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>¶Anna.</speaker>
               <p>And the ſame thing alſo is the cauſe of this my heuynes. For, in aſmuch as I am baptized into Chriſtes death,<note place="margin">A holy greyfe.</note> and am adorned with that moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſacred name of Chriſt, and am called a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian: It greeueth me, that I find not my hart furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and indued with ſuch plentiful, and ſound know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt my Lord, as it ought to be.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>☞Vrb.</speaker>
               <p>There be more then you, that in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half bewayle their infirmity, you are not alone ſick of this ſore, you haue a good many partakers in this grief, which taſt with you of this cup. True it is, there is much, and often mention made of Chriſt, and he is diligently preached, and many famous things are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norably, and truely ſpoken of him: and yet there be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many which neuertheles haue not yet perfectly, and playnly known him as they ought.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>¶Anna.</speaker>
               <p>But ſeeing I haue ſo great cauſe of grief, I cannot ceaſe ſorrowing before my eyes be opened, as the eyes of thoſe two diſciples were, which went to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maus, that I may haue the true, and ful knowledge of Chriſt. For I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber I haue heard you many times ſay, that there is no arte, no knowledge, nor no wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome more excellent, neceſſary, nor heauenly, then the knowledge of Chriſt, becauſe that knowledge bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with it euerlaſting righteouſnes, and ſaluation.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>☞Vrb.</speaker>
               <p>I confes I haue alwaies taught ſo, and ſo ſay I ſtil, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame alſo wil I both ſay &amp; teach while I liue, and my profeſſion is ſo to teach, and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. But there be ſome fantaſtical, and giddy heades, which ſet aſide Chriſts humanity, and wil be aloft, and ſo climing into the very heauens, buſely indeuour the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to ſearch and try out, what the euerlaſting, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, vnmeaſurable, &amp; incomprehenſible Deity of God is occupyed about. And marueylouſly, and buſely, they beat their braines, by ſharpnes of wit, to attaine to thoſe things which in the Scriptures are ſet down: of the eſſence, or being of God: of the perſons of God: of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:16253:12"/>
the vnderſtanding and knowledge of God: and of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, and other like. Where it is much more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and meet, that we geue our ſelues wholly ouer to learn, to finde out, and to know, what Chriſt is: and who he is. For, ſeeing that moſt high and infinite maieſty, hath abaſed it ſelf ſo extremely low, as that he vouchſafed to deſcend into the loweſt parts of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth to vs: and tooke our fleſh vpon him: and became man, that he might delyuer mankind, which was in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and thraldome of euerlaſting death: and hauing deliuered it, bring it to heauen to the glory of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, and euerlaſting life: Seeing (I ſay) thus ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the caſe, it is not meet that euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould make, and appoint for him ſelfe his own ladder, whereby to mount vp to God, to the glory of his maieſty: but it becommeth vs to vſe that ladder, &amp; thoſe ſteps, which God the father him ſelf hath ordayned, and appointed for that aſcention, and we muſt goe in by that path,<note place="margin">Chriſt the way to god.</note> and way which God the father him ſelf hath ſhewed, &amp; by which he would haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paſſage to heauen lye. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, our Sauiour Chriſt, in Iohn ſayd grauely, and for great cauſes, <hi>I am the way, and the truth, and the life: No man commeth vnto the Father but by me.</hi>
                  <note n="A" place="margin">Ioh. 14. v. 6.</note> If there had ben another, and ſhorter way: if there had been an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyer or redyer aſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, God had neuer, &amp; in vayn ſent his only begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſonne into the world: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wold he haue ſuffered him to take our miſerable, &amp; frayle nature vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, for this end only, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould (being made man &amp; after death rayſed to life) aſcend to heauen, and cary vs men with him to his father.</p>
               <p>The holy Scriptures call Chriſt a Peacemaker, a Mediator, a Prieſt, an Aduocate, a Shepheard, a Way, a Candle, a Lanthorn, a Light, a Maiſter, a King, a Head, a Redeemer, a Iuſtifyer, and Lyfe itſelf.</p>
               <p>With all theſe names and epithetons, doth the holy Scriptures adorn Chriſt. And why I pray you? Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely becauſe we can neither come to God the Father: be reconcyled to him: or haue any thing to do with him by any other meanes or way, but only by Chriſt, very God, and very man. To be ſhort, God cannot, will not, nor ſuffereth not him ſelf to be apprehended, or
<pb facs="tcp:16253:13"/>
found of vs without a Medyator. If you wil come to God: if you deſire to ſee the face of his diuine maieſty: if nearly, truly, and thorowly, you long to know God, then you muſt needs, firſt, wel, and perfectly know Chriſt our Mediator: if you ſet light by the knowledge of Chriſt, you ſhall neuer find God.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Eſay. 66.14</note>Eſay ſayth, that God hath ſet Chriſtes humanitye before vs, and diſplaid it, as it were a certain, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious enſigne, or ſtreamer, wherwith he might cal, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate, and gather together his Children out of the world to him ſelf. And S. Paul ſaith, that:<note n="C" place="margin">Mat. 11.27.</note>

                  </hi> And immediatly after theſe words, he allureth vs to come to him, ſaying: <hi>Come vnto me all ye that are wery and laden, and I wil eaſe you.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I haue alway both ſayd, and taught, that we muſt both learn, and know Chriſt. And I would to God, I had ſo ſhrill, loud, and ſtrong a voyce, and ſo many tongues, and mouthes, that I might ſound out, and fil the wholl world with this doctrine: God alſo ſayth:<note n="D" place="margin">Eſay. 53 11.</note> 
                  <hi>By his knowledge ſhal my righteous ſeruant iuſtifie many:</hi> that is to ſay, in the knowledge of him, or when he ſhalbe knowen. To know and vnderſtand Chriſt, is the moſt marueilous, and chiefeſt knowledge, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of all knowledge: for this knowledge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone clenſeth vs, iuſtifieth vs, and maketh vs free from al ſinne: and therfore the Apoſtles in all places preach this knowledge, and vnderſtanding of Chriſt, to all congregations: and they ſpeak of it, and beat it ſtil into the peoples eares,<note place="margin">How need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full it is to know Chriſt.</note> as the principall point, and chiefeſt article of the wholl Scripture. And Paul of purpoſe doth often vſe this word in all his Epiſtles, as in the ſecond to the Colloſſians:<note n="E" place="margin">Cor. 2.1.</note>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:16253:13"/>
of Chriſt, in whom are hid al the treaſures of wiſdome, and knowledge.</hi> And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame Paul, to the Corinthians who were puft vp with worldly wiſdome, and knowledge, braggeth of no other ſkil, and knowledge, then that he knew Chriſt crucified. He therefore which knoweth this Chriſt well, is paſſing well learned, and hath the knowledge of high &amp; great things: He which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him not, is rude and ignoraunt of that knowledge which may wel and truely be tearmed knowledge: He which knoweth Chriſt, the ſame knoweth God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and is delyuered from the horrible tiranny, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging might, and cruel violence of Sathan, and is free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from ſinne, from death, and from euerlaſting dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: He which knoweth not Chriſt, knoweth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him ſelf, nor God, he is bewitched, and blinded, he is an Ethnick, and Turk, he is inwraped in the bands of Sathan, and ſubiect to his Tiranny, yea he dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and abydeth in his ſinnes, in death, and in euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting damnation.</p>
               <p>What more horrible torment, what more greeuous los, and what greter miſery can there be, then to be in the thraldome, and power of Sathan, and to be all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether geuen ouer, both in body and ſoule, his bonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaue for euer? Wherefore, not without great cauſe are they heauy, and ſad, which know not Chriſt, becauſe they being ouerwhelmed, &amp; drowned in al calamities, haue not any that can either help them, or ſaue them. They alſo want that great, and excellent knowledge, which with true ioyes filleth both heauen, and earth, and is our onely ſaluation of body, and ſoule. As Chriſt ſaith in Iohn:<note n="F" place="margin">Iohn 17.3.</note>

               <p>By the grace, and goodnes of God, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue theſe things which you ſay: but my faith is ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and weak, and my knowledge, in the marucilous, and great miſteries of God, is not ſo great as it ought to be. And great darknes as yet ſo couereth the eyes of
<pb facs="tcp:16253:14"/>
my ſoule, that me thinks I can but hardly ſee them, as it were a far of, dimly, and through a darck cloud: and therfore I haue good cauſe to be ſad: and I harte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire of God, that he would lighten my hart with ſuch knowledge, that the true light may ſhine in my mind: &amp; that Chriſt alſo would ſo feed me, that I may hartely reioyce in the Lord as thoſe two diſcyples did, when Chriſt had inſtructed them, taught them, and geuen the bread vnto them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Vrb.</speaker>
               <p>If you aſke that hartely, and earneſtly, Chriſt will not forſake you, nor reiect your prayers: he hath commaunded that we ſhould aſke al good, and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſary thinges of him, and he hath mercifully promiſed that he will heare vs. But firſt of all he teacheth vs, to ſeeke the kingdome of heauen, and the righteouſnes therof: and he crieth, ſaying: <hi>If any man thirſt, let him come to me, and drink.</hi>

               <p>It is no maruell then that thoſe two Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were glad, ſeeing that Chriſt the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tain of life, was then preſent with them, and made ſo wonderful, and excellent a Sermon to them, wherby they knew him, and were filled with ioy, and frendly told it, and communicated it with the other Diſciples, ſaying: <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely the Lord is ryſen again.</hi> Would to God I might heare ſuch a Sermon, ſurely there is nothing in the world I had rather heare, then that Sermon which he made out of all the Prophets, and in which he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted him ſelf out of the hid treaſures of the Sacred Scriptures to his Diſciples, that they might perfectly know him, and be partakers of all perfect, and true ioy. That Sermon I ſay, that moſt excellent Sermon without all controuerſie, was of al other moſt comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and ful of power.</p>
               <p>If we knew thoſe thinges, or if thoſe thinges had been kept to the poſterities, which Chriſt then ſpake, no precious Iewel, nor Treaſure were comparable to them: and if that Treaſure were hid at the vttermoſt end of the earth, or beyond, we ought to indeuor, and procure with al ſpeed poſſible, that it might be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, and brought to vs.</p>

you earneſtly deſire to learn Chriſt, and to know what the holy Ghoſt in the holy Scriptures did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeake of him and peraduenture: you think that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be known what Chriſt ſpake then: and happely you think the catholick Church lacketh that moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Sermon: and that none haue knowne what y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſermon was, but thoſe two diſciples which heard it, in the way to Emaus.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Anna.</speaker>
               <p>I thought ſo in deed: and how could I think otherwiſe: ſeing it was nether left in writing by them that heard it to the poſteritie: nor deliuered to vs, as it were by hand,</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Vrb.</speaker>
               <p>You are deceiued. Chriſt had greater care ouer his church, &amp; thought more carefully of the ſafety ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, then that he would defraude and depriue it of ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For, for that cauſe moſt eſpecially was Chriſt ſent of the Father into the earth, that he might teach this ſermon, to all the Children of God. You ſee not now Chriſt face to face, but you heare his wordes and voyce by his Euangeliſts, and in theſe ſame wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his goſpel, you heare that ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which he made then to thoſe two his Diſciples. What? haue we not that incomparable &amp; great treaſure of his ſacred word, &amp; Prophets? beſides this, we ſee in the acts of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, how the Diſcyples vnderſtoode the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and writings of the Prophets concerning Chriſt: and how they propheſied by the inſpiration, and motion of the Spirit of truth, which was promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them before the death of Chriſt: and being ſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on whitſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>day, taught the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; put them in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of all thinges which were written of Chriſt, &amp; which Chriſt before his death, with his own tongue had taught them. And looke what ſoeuer the Holy Ghoſt taught them, it tended only to this end: That they might know Chriſt, and by Chriſt know the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and through this knowledge, be iuſtifyed, and ſaued.</p>

               <p>It is poſſible then, as far as I perceiue, to know what that Sermon was, which Chriſt made to thoſe two Diſcyples, as they went to Emaus, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he made their harts ſo burne within them. But
<pb facs="tcp:16253:15"/>
if I alſo might come to the hearing of that Sermon. Oh, I would deſire nothing in comparyſon of it: nay, I had rather heare that ſweet Sermon, then haue all the pleaſures in the earth, and ioyes of the world.</p>

               <p>You may eaſily coniecture what that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon was, ſeeing he expounded all the Prophets, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at Moyſes. Doth not Luke, I pray you, elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and plainly teſtifie, that he expounded to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all that is writen of him in the wholl Scripture?<note place="margin">Lukc. 24.</note> It was the Propheſies therfore, which are writen in the Scripture, of Chriſt, which he interpreted vnto them, which is nothing els, but euen the very Goſpel it ſelf, which he commaunded his Diſcyples to preach, and ſpread euen to the worlds end. For, this Goſpel is the doctrine of Chriſt, the Sonne of God, which telleth why he was made man, and declareth to vs the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall counſell of God the Father, and his great good wil to vs, in promiſing ſo redely that he wilbe our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and in imbraſing vs with more then a Fatherly affection: and in vouchſafeing to knowledge vs for his deere Sonnes: but onlye through his onlye begotten Sonne Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This Goſpel teacheth vs alſo, that the Father ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that when the fulnes of time was come, Chriſt ſhould be born true man of the ſeed of Dauid, and that he ſhould dye on the Croſſe, and riſe againe from the dead, to the end he might purge mannes ſinnes, pay the raunſom for them, deſtroy, and take away death, bring vs to euerlaſting life, reconcile his Father to vs, and aſcend into heauen, and ſitting there at the right hand of his Father, begin his true, and euerlaſting kingdome, where we ſhal raign, and reioyce with him for euer.</p>
               <p>Into this glory would his father haue him to enter by his own payn, paſſion, and opprobrious death of the Croſſe: That by this meanes he might deſerue the ſame glory for vs. This was done at Ieruſalem, vnder <hi>Herod, Pontius Pilat,</hi> and <hi>Caiphas,</hi> when <hi>Tiberius Caeſar</hi> was Emperor, and ſo were the Propheſies ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, which are written of him. Now he ſitteth at the right hand of Gods Maieſty, and being Lord of all, he

defendeth, and gouerneth his Church, that is to ſay, all godly, and truely beleeuing men, by the holy Ghoſt: and in the laſt day he ſhall come in his Maieſty, to iudge the quick and the dead, and ſhall geue euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Life to thoſe that beleeue: But he ſhall throw hedlong down into hel, amongſt the multitude of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, all thoſe that at that day, ſhall not haue beleeued the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>And he doth by his Miniſters dayly declare vnto vs, theſe his Merits, Works, precious Paſſion, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and Aſcention into Heauen: That thoſe which beleeue of Chriſt the ſonne of God, as the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do ſpeake of him, might be deliuered from the burthen of their ſinnes, be reconcyled to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and liue with him for euer in the glory of Chriſt. And for this cauſe eſpecially doth the goſpel moue vs, and cal vs to repentaunce, to the end, that we may be hartely ſory for our ſinnes: that we may abhor, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt our ſinnes: and with al our indeuour fly al things that might moue vs to ſinne: ſeeing our ſinnes could be taken away by no other Sacrifice, but only by the moſt precious bloud of Chriſt, which he ſhed for vs, that he might cleanſe vs, and delyuer vs from ſinne, death, and hel.</p>
               <p>And furthermore, the Goſpel promiſeth remiſſion of ſinnes, and euerlaſting life, to all that beleeue in Chriſt, and refuſe not this Goſpel, but with all their hart faithfully receiue the ſame, vſing it reuerently, and holyly. And thus of meere grace, without all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, only for the works, and merits of Chriſt, (if we beleeue in him) are we waſhed from our ſinne, beute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed with the holy Ghoſt, and are iuſtifyed, ſanctifyed, ſaued, and made heyres with God, and coheyres with Chriſt in his kingdome, and liue for euer.</p>
               <p>We alſo heare the Goſpell with a godly deuotion, we truſt in Chriſt, and we beleeue him to be the only Sauyour of the world. And then alſo, are we angry with our ſinnes, and deteſt, and abhor them, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent vs, and are ſory, that through our ſinnes we haue offended God, we begin better to frame our liues, and we loue God with all our harts, which hath beſtowed
<pb facs="tcp:16253:16"/>
his great, and wonderful mercy, and his vnſpeakable, and infinite goodnes in Chriſt Ieſu his Sonne vpon vs: we loue alſo our neighbours, euen as Chriſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vs: and we doe our diligence that we may (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh holy children) lead a chaſt, holy, modeſt, ſober, and innocent life, after Chriſtes example: and ſo for the loue of righteouſnes, and godlynes, we doe all good works: ſauing that, while we are in this fleſh we haue not the full feeling of our frailtye, and ſinne: and that our faith, and knowledge of Chriſt, that is, of the great, and incomprehenſible mercy, loue, care, grace, and benefits, which in Chriſt, and for Chriſt, are freely geuen, and beſtowed vpon vs, is not full perfect, and pure in this life, but while we liue, doth ſtil grow, and increaſe.</p>
               <p>And we muſt alſo fight, and ſtriue continually, while we liue with the fleſh, and mortefie, renue, and reforme our old Adam, vntil the Image of God be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued again in vs, and vntil we ſhall haue put on that moſt beutiful, and holy Image of Chriſt, like as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our receiuing of faith, and regeneration, we did beare that euil fauoured, and horrible Image of the old Adam.</p>
               <p>Now you haue heard what Chriſt taught his two Diſciples. And without doubt, the Apoſtls afterward taught the ſame things which Chriſt did teach, and confirmed the doctrine of Chriſt after the ſame ſort, by the Prophets wrytings.

               <p>Moyſes hath written much of Chriſt, as Chriſt himſelf witneſſeth in Iohn: where (ſpeaking to the Iewes) he ſaith: <note n="A" place="margin">Iohn. 4 46.</note> 
                  <hi>If you had beleeued Moyſes, you had alſo beleeued me, for he wrote of me.</hi> And Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes euen in the beginning, as ſoone as, heauen, earth, and man, were made, ſaith, that the Serpent (to wit) Sathan, deceiued Eue: and entyced her to make a lye: and ſeduced her: and ſhe afterward perſwaded, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceued Adam: and ſo (God being deſpiſed, and ſet aſide) brought him, and threw him headlong into the ſame calamitie: and thus they beleeued a lye, wherin they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted an horrible offence, becauſe they broke Gods commandement: and did not obey the Lord their God as their duety was: but were obedyent vnto the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil, which from the beginning is a lyar, and a mankil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, into whoſe power, and tiranny they fel both in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ſoule by their tranſgreſſion, and diſobeydience: and ſo death (by the ſinne of Adam) came in both vpon Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; al Adams poſterity: in ſo much, that by the iuſt iudgement, and iuſtice of God, all men ſhould haue entered, by the death of this body, into euerlaſting death. And thus did death through ſinne mightely raign in all the world.</p>
               <p>Alas, what is more horrible then this power of ſinne, and this extreame calamity which caſteth vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to euerlaſting damnation? What burthen is there he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyer, or harder then this? and what more cruell miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe could there haue hapned then this? But God here, in the middeſt of this danger being mindful of his mercy (as the Prophet ſaith of him) found a moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and ſoueren ſalue for this ſore: to wit, he offred vs his grace, and promyſed that he would pardon our ſin, and deſtroy death by a certain marueilous meane: to wit, by his only begotten Sonne, who when the fulnes of time, that is to ſay, when the determined time was come, was ſent into the earth from heauen,
<pb facs="tcp:16253:18"/>
and ſalued this ſore, that is to ſay, redeemed, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the poore pryſoner mankind, out of the tyranny, and power of darknes, and Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and that after a ſtrange, and ſecret ſort. For he tooke vpon him the ſhape of a ſeruant, and being made man, ſubiect to all miſery, calamity, and troble of this life, yea and death it ſelf, (but yet free from all faulte, and pure without ſinne,) vouchſafed to dye for vs, that he might by his death take away our ſinnes: and he roſe again from the dead, and threw Sathan, all conquered, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, vnderfoote: and bereued him of the ſpoyle, and pray, which through his falſe lye, he had brought into the bondage of ſinne,<note place="margin">The firſt promiſe of grace.</note> death, and damnation: that is to ſay, he brought mankind again into the kingdome of God, which is, the kingdom of health, and euerlaſting life. This is the firſt promiſe of grace: <note n="B" place="margin">Gen. 3</note> 
                  <hi>I wil put enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty betwixt thee, and the woman, &amp; betwixt thy ſeede, and her ſeede, He</hi> (that is to ſay, the ſeed of the woman, for ſo is the Hebrue text) <hi>ſhal break thy head, and thou ſhalt bruſe his heele.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe words God promyſed his Sonne to the world. And this promiſe is the Goſpel it ſelf, that is to ſay, moſt mery, and pleaſant tidings of Chriſt. Adam being now drowned in ſinne: and the child of wrath: and being both in body, and ſoule ſubiect to the curſe, ſaw nothing but euerlaſting damnation: and therefore his conſcience was miſerably trobled, vexed, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, ſo that in this his agony, he was almoſt come euen to deſperations dore. For he felt no kind of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, but the horrible torment of euerlaſting death, and bitter greef of hart. For he had caſt him ſelf by diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyence into the tiranny of Sathan, and was now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his priſoner, and ſeruant through ſinne.</p>
               <p>But as ſoon as God had promyſed to him the ſeed of the woman, ſtraight way he conceaued hope of life: and beleeued that god of his grace, and mercy, would by that promiſed ſeed ſaue him, and delyuer him out of Sathans tyrannye.<note place="margin">C. Rom. 1</note> 
                  <hi>The Goſpell therfore is the promiſe of lyfe, in this ſeede of the woman,</hi> or through this ſeede.</p>
               <p>Thus then God promiſed his naturall ſone, which ſhould be born of a woman, (but without ſinne), that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16253:18"/>
he might tread down, and breake Sathans head, that is to ſay, that he might ouerthrow Sathans power and kingdome, which is the kingdome of ſinne, and death, and that he might tread vnderfoote, ouercome, and deſtroy ſinne, death, and hel.<note place="margin">Gal. 3.</note> This promiſed ſeede is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as Paule ſayth.

For if that ſeede had bene nothing els but man, he could neuer haue broken the head of Sathan, (that is) haue aboliſhed ſinne, and death: and, haue ſubdued, and deſtroyed, Sathan him ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, theſe wordes import, that this ſeede ſhould not be ſubiect to any ſinne: neither be naturally conceiued, after the manner of man, and of mans ſeede but by the holy ghoſt: and that, this ſeede ſhould not be born as al other mankinde is, of a woman that had known a man, but of a pure virgin. Therfore is he not here called the ſeed of man, but onely of woman.</p>
               <p>Alſo, ſeing he would deliuer, and make mankind free from the tyranny of Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: (ſinne being taken away) it was needefull that all ſinnes ſhould firſt be purged: and that he ſhould firſt ſatiſfie the high, and, ſeuere iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, (and ſo this ſeede, or this ſonne of this woman is ſet in the place of a captiue man) &amp; ſeing all mankinde for ſinne was appointed to dye: it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined that he, to wit, this ſeed of the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould ſuffer death, that by his death, he might pay, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the ſinnes of mankinde: That, we being deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, from the power, and tyrannie of Sathan, might be reconciled to our God, by a ſufficient purgation, and ſatiſfaction.</p>
               <p>Now then, if he ought thus to tread downe the head of Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to wit, aboliſh death: it could in no wiſe be, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould ſtill abide in the graue: but ſeing he ſhould dye for out offences, leauing this fraile, and temporall life, it was very neceſſary that he ſhould riſe againe from death, and begin, and poſſes another euerlaſting life. Otherwiſe, he could neuer haue delyuered man from ſo great, and horrible a calamity, wherin he was. Neither could man haue been ſaued, vnles ſatiſfaction
<pb facs="tcp:16253:19"/>
had been made for his ſinnes: and vnles death had bin ouercome: and eternal life ſo obteyned, and geuen, that neither ſinne, death, nor Satan, could further hurt vs. Furthermore as the Text here maketh mention: there is enmity betwixt Chriſt, and that Serpent the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil. And by this ſame Text we know which of them ſhould get the victory: to wit, the ſeed Chriſt with his ſeruants, he ſhal ouercome, and tread down Sathan that venemous Serpent. And although that Serpent doe neuer ſo deadly ſting the heele of Chriſt, and the true Church (that is) perſecute, and tempt them: yet Chriſt being both far greater, mightyer, and ſtronger then he, doth return Conqueror from the bataile, and caryeth away the victory, and in the end tryumpheth with the whol Church (that is with the true godly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing,) which ſhal raign, and liue with Chriſt fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. And thus in this promiſe is foretold (as you ſee) the birth, paſſion, and reſurrection of Chriſt, together with the victory, wherin Chriſt broke the force of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, ſinne, death, and hel.</p>
               <p>And though in hid, and figuratiue words, yet ſuch, as admit no other ſence, but truely, and plainly import that, which we haue ſayd. Chriſt is prefigured, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of in the Scripture, two wayes. Sometime in darck, figuratiue, and hidden promiſes, and types. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſometimes, in manyfeſt promiſes, and expres, and playn words. Therfore all promiſes which followed this in the Byble, did betoken this ſeed, and are to be applyed to this ſeed, and are made more manifeſt, and known, vntil Chriſt put on our fleſh, &amp; fulfilled them. Some Latin Bibles in this Text of Geneſis, haue it: <hi>She ſhall tread down the head of the Serpent,</hi> not <hi>he,</hi> nor <hi>it.</hi> Wherupon it grue, that this promiſe was taken to be ſpoken of Mary, as if ſhe had troden down the Ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pents head. But this promis can in no wiſe be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Mary. The Hebrue tongue ſaith not <hi>She,</hi> but <hi>It,</hi> doth perform this work. And the ſame Text doth vnderſtand the ſeed of the woman. For thus ſaith the holy Ghoſt, in that Sacred tongue wherein the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies were writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Vben ſarecha, Vben ſarach hu ieſchup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha roſch.</hi> That is, <hi>I wil put enmity betwixt thy Seed,

and the Seed of her,</hi> (that is to ſay,) euen the ſeed of the woman ſhall tread down thy head. For it is euident, that <hi>Hen</hi> doth not ſignifie her, but <hi>Him,</hi> or <hi>It,</hi> and this is the proper, and right ſignification of this word.<note place="margin">T' at is the Caldey bible.</note>

               <p>He which reiecteth this ſeed, and truſteth not in him with all his hart, he peryſheth, he is vndone, he is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned to damnation, he is the bondſlaue of Sathan, (how great ſo euer he be) both in body, and ſoule.

               <p>Here muſt we diligently mark,<note place="margin">Only by Chriſt not by our ſelus or workes are we ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid.</note> that God doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe help, deliueraunce, and ſure victory of Sathan, death, and ſinne: but not without our Mediator, not for our own ſakes, not by our own ſtrength, not for our own vertues, not by our own wiſdom, not by our own ſkil, not for our deſerts, or worthines.

               <p>And though he (as his nature is) ſting, and hiſſe at all the Children of Adam, and miſerably vexe, greeue, and torment them with temptations, lyes, hereſies, perſecutions, ſinnes, and death it ſelf: Yet all that he can doe againſt the godly, though he be neuer ſo enuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and wicked, is nothing els but hiſſing: yea, he is ſo far from hurting, or harming them, that he greatly euen profiteth them, when he killeth them, and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to hurt them.</p>
               <p>For, by that hiſſing, wherwith he aſſayled the Seed of the woman, he bringeth mankind out of this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and wretched world, into moſt happy, and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting bleſſednes. And the womans Seed, that is to ſay, Chriſt, who himſelf alſo, vnder the ſhape of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, was lifted vp in the wildernes, doth in the mean time, break his head, &amp; beat it all to pouder.

               <p>Paul to the Romanes, ſaith: that <note n="M" place="margin">Rom. 1.1</note> 
                  <hi>the Goſpell of God, concerning Chriſt, was long before promiſed by the Prophets, in the holy Scriptures.</hi> And Peter ſaith in the Actes:<note n="N" place="margin">Act. 3.24.</note> 
                  <hi>Al the Prophets, from Samuel, and thenceforth, as many, as haue ſpoken, haue likewiſe foretold of theſe dayes.</hi> That is to ſay, they told of that moſt deſired, and holeſome time: of the new, and euerlaſting Teſtament: and of the eternal, and vnfallible mercy of God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to Dauid.

and embrace Chriſt, as the true, and only Sauiour of the world.

                  <hi>Repentance,</hi> which is the firſt part of a Chriſtian mannes life, as Chriſt him ſelfe teacheth vs. For if all people in this ſeede,<note place="margin">Repentance the firſt ſtep to grace.</note> be bleſſed: It neceſſarily followeth, that al nations, (that is to ſay, all men) which ſprong of Adam, are without it accurſed, and abhominable before God.

               <p>It is needful, therfore, that firſt of all, there ſhould be in vs repentance. For, <note n="b." place="margin">Pſal. 51.5</note> 
                  <hi>in ſinne are we conceiued, and born.</hi> And, <note n="c." place="margin">Rom. 5.12</note> 
                  <hi>by one man, ſinne entered into the world, and death by ſinne: And ſo death went ouer all men: foraſmuch as all men haue ſinned, and by the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of one, the fault came on all men, to condemnation.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:16253:23"/>
This fault, is originall ſinne, which to vs (the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and poſterity of Adam) commeth of naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie ſucceſſiuely: and dwelleth in vs all, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth with vs in our firſt carnal birth, by which all our nature is corrupted, defyled, deformed, depraued, and made offenſiue.<note place="margin">What we are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> So that we, by nature originally, are naturally wicked, and ignorant, both of God, and our ſelues: we beleeue not God: we truſt not God: we ſeek not after God: and we neither dread Gods thret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, nor regard his commaundements: And final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we, by nature, neither feare, nor loue God.

               </p>
               <p>Thus then, the whol nature of man, is by the firſt ſinne of Adam, diſobedient, infected, beſtained, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, depraued, and in the very firſt natiuity, defiled. Further, when man is grown vp to age, and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

to haue iudgement of things: in continuance of time, by the force, and inclination of this original ſinne, he rouleth, or deſireth to roul him ſelf, in all kind of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous pleaſure: in euery foul ſink of ſinne: in euery durty puddle of deteſtable actes: and in all kind of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannes: as we ſee with our eyes.

                  <hi>The wages of ſinne, is death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, then, we learn firſt, by this promiſe, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our miſery, calamity, and curſednes, and the wrath, and iudgement of God.

               <p>Moreouer, we ſet our ſelues againſt our neighbor, and loue him not, as we ought. For when we be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, but euen lightly, we hate him deadly. Thus are we ful of enuy, and gilty of all kind of wickednes. Wherfore, ſeeing by nature, we be voyd of al ſuch ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, as the law of God requyreth in vs, (as, that we ſhould fear God, beleeue God, loue God, glorify God, and alſo, faithfully, and intierly loue our neighbour:) And ſeeing, we thus obay not the law, as we ought,
<pb facs="tcp:16253:24"/>
the law of God, doth pronounce a moſt terrible ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt vs, ſaying: <note n="r." place="margin">Deut. 27.26.</note>

Nay, you ſhal neuer, of them all, be able to bring me, one: For in deed, none euer did it: Nay, we all doe the contrary, for, ſuch as the tree is, ſuch is the fruit. And how pleaſant, and prety, the fruit of the fleſh is, that is to ſay, of the natural, or carnal man, if it pleaſe you, you may ſee in the Epiſtle to the Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, where Paul, by the way, hath ſet down, though not all, yet a few of the works of the fleſh, as. <note n="u" place="margin">Gal. 5.19 The frutes of our fleſh naturally.</note>

               </p>
               <p>The law, therfore, of God, doth wound, hold cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, greeuouſly oppreſſe, and accuſe, all the children of Adam, of impiety: and it layeth to our charge, that foul offence of rebellion, againſt Gods maieſty: and, it conuicteth vs to be an vngracious kind of creatures, ful of profeſſed malice, and wickednes, and ſubiect to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall damnation, vngodly <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Seeing then, the law of God, doth thus examine our life, and our manners, it plainly appeareth, both what kind of men we be, what our faults, and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be, and how huge ſinners we be. And foraſmuch, as we haue not fulfilled the law of God, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all things, which are written in the book of the law: it neceſſarily followeth, that the curſe hangeth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:16253:24"/>
preſently ouer vs, and that, we be. <note n="x." place="margin">Gal. 3.22</note> 
                  <hi>concluded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus lyeth wretched mankind, thrown down, damned, and ſubiect to euerlaſting death, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, for that he is accurſed. The curſe of the law,<note place="margin">Where then be papiſtical merites?</note> is the fault, and the puniſhment, and both preſent, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal indignation, wrath, anguiſh, affliction, death, and euerlaſting torment in hel fire. If this, then, be the condition of our eſtate, (as in deed it is, if we beleeue the Scriptures, witneſſing of the calamity, and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fall of Adam, and his poſterity) then muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, all preſumption, and truſt in our own ſtrength, worthynes, merits, natural hability, and good works, geue place, and vaniſh away: and true humility, and vnfayned repentance follow. For, of what, I pray you, can man glory? how can he preſume? what can he attribute to his own ſtrength? and how can he brag, if he haue right feeling of this curſe? and ſo, that he ſee, he is become an Apoſtata, a traytor, and a runnagate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, and altogether the Deuils thrall, lying captiue vnder the power of ſinne, death, and malediction. And ſuch in deed is his eſtate. For, he is conceiued, and born in ſinne, and he cannot, ſo much of himſelf, as think wel, wiſh wel, or doe wel: but being proue, and bent, only to euil, to vice, and to all wickednes, he doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſinne.</p>
               <p>Now, he which doth rightly feel, the immutable, and very ſeuerity of Gods wrath, to him, the world it ſelf is an vnpleaſant pryſon, neither doth it graunt him reſt, or comfort, at all, til he be free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe bands, and curſes.</p>
               <p>Wherfore, the holy Scripture, vpon good cauſe,<note place="margin">The cauſe why we are threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the law.</note> doth moſt diligently, and earneſtly, vrge vpon vs, the law, to this end: that man, thus all blinded, peruerſt, and malicious, may, by the law, be drawn, to know him ſelf, to ſee his miſery, and to feel the curſe, and his incorporated wickednes, and the iudgement of God: So that, by the liuely feeling of his ſin, &amp; gods wrath, he might humbly, and truly, with a troubled Spirite, and contrite hart, reuerently with ſubmiſſion, flye to the throne of grace, and call for mercy, &amp; help of God,
<pb facs="tcp:16253:25"/>
and with all his hart, runne vnto, and imbrace Chriſt, his only Sauyour, the bleſſed ſeed of Abraham.</p>
               <p>To ſuch, verely, is this bleſſed ſeed ſent: which, after this ſort, with a troubled Spirite, and a broken, and humble hart, acknowledge, and confes their ſinnes: and, which hartely repenting, are greeuouſly, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly vexed, and afflicted in conſcience, becauſe they haue ſinned.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">To whom Chriſt was ſent.</note>To theſe, I ſay, is he ſent: that, hauing taken away the curſe, to the which, they were ſubiect, he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuer them, from all perils, and calamities, both of ſoule, and body. For, there is none, that deſire, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue Chriſt, but theſe poore ones in Spirit. And this doe Paules words import, in the Epiſtle to the Rom. where he ſaith: <note n="Y" place="margin">Ro. 3.20.</note> 
                  <hi>By the law, commeth the knowledge of ſinne.</hi> And to the Galathians: <note n="Z" place="margin">Gal. 3.24</note> 
                  <hi>The law was our Scholemaſter, to bring vs to Chriſt, that we might be made righteous, through faith.</hi> And in the ſame place he ſayth: <hi>The law began, and was geuen, 430. yeares, after the holy promiſe was made to Abraham, and that, for tranſgreſſion vntil the ſeed, came, to whom it was promyſed, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All natures ſtrength, all wiſdome, all free will, all good lawes, and all creatures, yea, Gods law it ſelfe, (becauſe of mannes infirmity) could not delyuer, iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and free man from this curſe: But of neceſſity, this bleſſed ſeed, Chriſt, muſt needes be ſent to delyuer vs, from theſe euils: and deſerue for vs, and alſo, geue vs, the holy Ghoſt: els, had man ſtil remayned, altogether <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, that is to ſay, helples.</p>
               <p>Therfore, Paul, in the ſame place, excellently diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the law, and Chriſt, ſaith thus: <note n="Z" place="margin">Gal. 3.21.</note> 
                  <hi>In deed, if there had a law bin geuen, which, could haue geuen life, then truely, righteouſnes ſhould haue beene by the law. But the Scripture hath concluded all vnder ſinne, that the promiſe, by faith of Ieſus Chriſt, might be geuen to them, that beleeue.</hi> But, before faith came, we were kept vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law, and ſhut vp vnto the faith, which ſhould afterward be reuealed, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The law, indeed, may ſhew vs our ſinnes, conuince vs, accuſe vs, and condemne vs of ſinne, and it may bring vs vnder the curſe: but it can neuer delyuer vs
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:16253:25"/>
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the curſe. The law, was cheefly geuen to this end, that by terrifying our harts,<note place="margin">The end why the law was geuen.</note> it might ſtirre vs vp fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uently to deſire, and flye vnto that bleſſed ſeede Chriſt, in whom we finde, and receiue all thinges, which the law requireth of vs, to wit, perfect obedience, inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, righteouſnes, the fulfilling of all lawes, and the holy Ghoſt, with all his gifts, as faith, loue, feare, and charity towards our neighbour, with ſuch like. The wholl Scripture doth nothing els, but teach vs tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly to know Chriſt, earneſtly to deſire Chriſt, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely to craue help of Chriſt, faithfully to beleeue in Chriſt, and truely to loue Chriſt. But this we cannot doe, vnles we firſt feel the curſe, and acknowledge our miſeries, ſicknes, and ſinne. When we haue once the liuely feeling of theſe things, then with all greedy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of hart, we gape for that bleſſed ſeede, becauſe he onely, and alone, both can, and will clerely altogether take away this curſe. If the Iewes had knowen this, and beleeued, they had neuer ſo deſpyſed, and crucifyed Chriſt: And if the Phariſies, and Hipocrites of theſe dayes, and we, knew theſe things, we would vtterly diſpaire of our ſelues, &amp; of our merits, and of all mans ſtrength, in which there is no bealth, or help at all, wherby we may look for the obtayning of iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſaluation: nay, we would not in all theſe put either hope, or truſt: but would flie to this ſeed, where preſent helpe, and ayde is found.</p>
               <p>If our ſinnes doe not thus plainly appeare by the law vncurable: fooliſh, and blind reaſon, ſtraight way dreameth, that ſhe can ſalue this ſore, and that ſhe her ſelfe can deliuer vs from ſinne: yea ſhe doth aſſay, by her works, to deſerue Gods fauor, nether will ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this bleſſed ſeed, nether is ſhe moued with any deſire of him, nether doth ſhe any thing eſteem of the great promiſes of God, by which only, we (moſt miſerable creatures) are delyuered from theſe euils. Wherfore, firſt learn, and know this: that,<note place="margin">Fayth ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth.</note> as Abraham was iuſtifyed before God: ſo, ſurely muſt we alſo be iuſtifyed: but, he was iuſtifyed by this ſeed Chriſt, in him he beleeued, and in him had he all his hope, and truſt of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> repoſed, being perſwaded, that by this
<pb facs="tcp:16253:26"/>
ſeed, he ſhould obtain the bleſſing.<note n="a." place="margin">Gen 15.6</note> 
                  <hi>And that was cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him for righteouſnes.</hi> Paul therfore, concludeth, and mightely affirmeth, that we muſt couet this ſeed, ſaying: <note n="b." place="margin">Rom. 4.13.</note> 
                  <hi>The promiſe, that he ſhould be the heyr of the world, was not geuen to Abraham, or to his ſeed, through the law, but through the righteouſnes of faith.</hi> For, if they which are of the Law, be heires, faith is made void, and the promiſe of none effect: For the law cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth wrath: for where no law is, there is no tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, therefore is the heritage, giuen by fayth, that it might come by grace, and the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeede, not to that only which is of the law, but alſo to that which is of the fayth of Abraham.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in this mere promiſe, the great and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite grace of God doth appeare. For, our deſert, or worthynes did not deſerue, that God ſhould vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to be made man of the ſeed of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but it was the meere grace, and mercy of God. Of his meere grace, he promyſed Chriſt, and of his meere grace, he performed his promiſe, by ſending of Chriſt: the law, and the workes of the law, neuer deſerued it. For, you ſee here that God promiſed this bleſſing, to the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch Abraham,<note place="margin">Cauſe why God made the promiſe before the law.</note> 
                  <hi>430.</hi> yeares before the law was giuen to Moſes: which he did, leaſt man ſhould attribute ſome thing, in the worke of lyfe, and ſaluation to him ſelfe, and ſo glory in his owne merites: for grace is not mingled with works, it is without all our deſeruing, and before all our good workes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for as much as God would lay the cauſe of his bleſſing, and grace, which we receaue, vpon Chriſt, &amp; through him wil onely bleſſe, whome he doth bleſſe: It neceſſarily followeth, that, without Chriſt, there is neither bleſſing, righteouſnes, lyfe nor health: and that, all that are without Chriſt, be accurſed: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they remaine in ſinne, death, and damnation. We may well thinke, there was ſome weightye cauſe, that moued our gratious, immortall, &amp; high God, to ſpeake a thing of ſuch weight, &amp; a thing which is ſo full of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, where in he bindeth himſelf, with an oth, that he would, through this ſeede, geue vs his bleſſing and life euerlaſting. Ought not (I pray you) the whole
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:16253:26"/>
company of Angels, with all kinde of men, &amp; all ſorts of creatures, both in heauen and earth, with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, holines, pietye, and with vnſpeakeable, and infinite ioye, heare their Lord God, ſpeaking theſe wordes, and promiſing ſuch precious giftes? Paule ſayth. <note n="c." place="margin">Heb. 6.17.</note> 
                  <hi>God willing more aboundantly, to ſhew vnto the heires of promiſe, the ſtablenes of his counſaile bound him ſelfe with an oth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And do you not here ſee, that he, both promiſeth, and alſo ſweareth? but if then any could obtayne this bleſſing, (that is) life and ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without Chriſt: why hath God promiſed, the bleſſing in Chriſt, ſo earneſtly, yea, and that, with an oth? Wherfore I ſee not, why, any ſhould thinke, he can beleue in God, and yet is not in the Chriſtian faith.</p>
               <p>No in deede, there is no trew faith,<note place="margin">The chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian fayth onely the true fayth.</note> but the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fayth. All other opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s be errors. God will take none for his, vnleſſe he be in this ſeede. Chriſt, (that is) if he be not a Chriſtian, if he beleue not in Chriſt. Nether in deede, ſhall we euer, any where, finde the fauour of God, true innocencye, righteouſnes, ſatiſfaction for our ſinnes, helpe, counſaile, life, and ſaluation, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this Chriſt. The Fathers beleued in him, before he was made man, and were ſaued.</p>
               <p>In him alſo beleue wee, and are ſaued. And in this promiſe, alſo, is proued the humain birth, death, reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and eternall kingdome of Chriſt, which all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to this bleſſing, in which all happines is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. For this benediction, in the ſeede of Abraham, is libertie, and abſolution from ſinne: and deliuerance from death and euerlaſting damnation: and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, it is pure innocencye, righteouſnes, fulfilling of the lawe, and renuing of the image of God in vs with ſecuritye, ioy, peace, and life euerlaſting. What more can you deſire? In this Chriſt is all righteouſnes included, and all kinde of curſednes excluded.

Now this propheſy muſt needes haue bene fulfilled: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt the houſe of Dauid, before the byrth of Chriſt be depriued of all kingly glory, and be contemned, and counted, as it were an old, vnprofitable, &amp; withered, balke: which came to paſſe in thoſe <hi>129.</hi> yeares, in which after <hi>Ianus Hircanus, Aſmonay,</hi> that is to ſay, Iudas with his kinſfolke, nephews, and poſteritie, executed the office both of the ſpirituall, and ſecular power.

whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Antiochus beganne to vex them, and when the Machabees tooke vpon them the prieſtly, and kingly dignity, might eaſely haue coniectured, and by euident ſignes haue ſene, that the tyme was now at hand, in which <hi>Siloh,</hi> ſhould come.</p>
               <p>Moreouer there is no cauſe, why that ſhort time of the Machabees raigne ſhould trouble vs, (neither is it much to the purpoſe) for though they were not at all of the tribe of Iuda, yet did they gouerne in the place of the tribe of Iuda, and Dauid, and prouided for the tribe of Iuda: &amp; defended, and preſerued that tribe, and Beniamin, togither with the prieſthode, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, euen vnto the tyme wherin <hi>Siloh</hi> came. For the tribe of Iuda had neither kinges, nor princes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them ſelues, nor of their ſtock, and kindred, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet any of their affinitie that bore rule: but it was altogether vnder the ſubiection of others.

               <p>The ſtate, and order of his prieſthoode is maruelous, and altogether differing from the ſtate of the prieſts of the law. In the law of Moſes there was a prieſthood of the tribe of Leui.

But this prieſthood could deliuer none from their ſinne, or from the curſe.

All theſe were fulfilled in Chriſt,<note place="margin">Pſal. 110.4</note> as Dauid witneſſeth, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>The Lord hath ſworn, and will not repent, thou art a prieſt for euer after the order of Melchiſedech:</hi> (That is to ſay) Thou art a prieſt cleane after another ſort then Aaron, and his ſucceſſors were. For they were mortall men, who by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, or law of God could condemne, and bring al men vnder the curſe: but could not deliuer, or quit any man from the curſe. And ſuch were both their ſacrifices, &amp; the prieſthod itſelfe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they could not take away euen the leaſt ſinne that is: But thou O Chriſt art the true Melchiſedech, the euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, and true king, and prieſt. And this muſt you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this ſort vnderſtand. Chriſt in earth hath no father,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:16253:32"/>
and in heauen no mother: he is euerlaſting God, and alſo immortall man. And in this order, neither went any before him, nor ſhall come after him.

               <p>I know that Mathew wrighteth a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loge of Chriſt was not the ſonne of Ioſeph: but ſeeyng Chriſt was not the ſonne of Ioſeph: but onely of Mary, the pure virgin, which neuer knew man, being conceaued by the operation, and vertue of the holy Ghoſt, without mans ſeede, not after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and naturall order, of mans conception: as the text in playn words doth teſtifie, ſaying: <hi>of whom,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is,<note place="margin">In this 1. chapter of Math. the relatiue is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feminine gender, and therfore is referred to Mary, and not to Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph.</note> of the which Mary, <hi>was borne Ieſus.</hi> I do not yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how Chriſt can come of the ſtocke, and linage of Abraham, and ſo of Dauid. For what I pray you doth Ioſephs kinne, or family make to Chriſts byrth, ſeing Chriſt was not the ſonne of Ioſeph. In deede if S. Mathew had recited Maries ancetors, and proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors, from Abraham to Marye, ſo it might haue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared very euidently, and playnely that the promiſe had ben fulfilled: or if S. Mathew had proued, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that Marye had ben Dauids daughter, or of Dauids houſe, then I thinke there would haue ben no cauſe of doubting: but (for all my ſimple capacitie) it would haue bene both eſy &amp; playne, and yet I would not you ſhould think I ſpeake this as one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> doubteth any thing at all of the truth of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>For I beleue verely, that all which is in the ſcripture is moſt true: and I yeld vnto God ſuch dew honor, that I beleue, that his word is (as it is in deed) the truth it ſelfe, and ſuch a ſound certaynty, and ſure fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>In aſmuch as Mathew ſayth, that the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mary the mother of Chriſt was betrowthed to
<pb facs="tcp:16253:38"/>
Ioſeph, he needed not recken vp the petegrees of the woman, or the genealogy of Mary: for it was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſet out Ioſephs petegree, whereby it is of it ſelf playne, and certayne, that Mary was of the tribe of Dauid, and ſo Chriſt the ſonne of Dauid. For as Hierom ſayth, the ſcripture doth not vſe to draw the petegree of the woman. This is the truth of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Ioſeph, and Mary were both of one tribe, to wit, of the tribe of Iuda. For Ioſeph tooke Marye (who was his coſin) to wife, according to the law of the Lord in Nume, the wordes of the law be theſe.</p>

                  <hi>They ſhalbe wiues to whome they thinke beſt, onely to the familye of the tribe of their father ſhall they mary. So ſhall not the inheritance of the children remoue from tribe to tribe: for euery one of the children of Iſraell ſhall ioyne himſelfe to the inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the tribe of his fathers. And euery daughter that poſſeſſeth any inheritance of the tribes of the children of Iſraell ſhalbe wife vnto one of the family of the tribe of her father: that the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael may enioy euery man the inheritance of their fathers, neither ſhal the enheritance go about from tribe to tribe: but euery one of the tribes of the children of Iſraell, ſhall ſtick to his owne enheritance, as the Lord co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mmaunded.</hi> Here now it appeareth, that (in as much as Ioſeph, and Mary were ſpouſed together) they were both of one tribe, and family. For ſhe could not marry any man, vnleſſe he were her coſen, or of his owne tribe, &amp; linage. If therfore Ioſeph be of the tribe of Iuda, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry his ſpouſe is alſo of the tribe of Iuda. Wherfore S. Math. in that he drew the genealogy of Chriſt, from Zerobabell, &amp; Abiud, comming downe to Ioſeph, the huſband of Mary, drew it well, and truly, according to Moiſes his law. Yet S. Luke draweth this genealogy from Zerobabell by Reſa, Iohanna, Iuda, or Ioſeph, Semei, til he came to Hely, and ſo to Ioakim, who was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father of the virgin Mary, the bleſſed mother of God. And this genelogy is alſo both trew, &amp; very wel drawne. You heard a little before a propheſye out of Eſay, which ſayth. <note n="e." place="margin">Eſai. 11.1</note>

               <p>Chriſt as I thinke onely expounded thoſe propheſies, which are written of his paſſion, death, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and glory. Becauſe in thoſe, that is to ſay, in his paſſion they were moſt offended, ſuppoſing, in ſo much as they had ſeene him end his natural lyfe vpon the Croſſe, there had bin neither counſaile, hope, nor helpe left in him for Iſraell to looke for: and for this cauſe were they ſo ſad. They ſorrowed and were pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue becauſe they knew not, nor thought not, that Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias ought firſt to ſuffer that vile, and ignominious death, and riſe agayne, and ſo enter into his glory, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme the world, and remaine our God for euer, as I haue ſayd before. But when they now vnderſtood the propheſies of his paſſion, and reſurrection: and when they had learned by the prophets, that it was gods wil and ordinance, that Meſſias by dying ſhould become Lord of life, &amp; death, they had no further cauſe to ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and therfore their hartes were ſo ioyfull, and their hope ſo ſure, that they could not hide their ioy, but vttered, and participated it with their fellow diſciples, which were at Ieruſalem.</p>

                  <p>The Prophet Micha ſpeaketh of Bethleem, and conſidereth the caſe it was then in, when he liued: for beyng compared with Ieruſalem and other gorge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and populous cities in Iuda, it appeared as then contemnable, little, and of ſmall countenance. It was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Ieruſalem and Samaria, as if I ſhould at this day compare <hi>Fridberg</hi> in Germany, with the famous citie <hi>Auſpurge,</hi> or <hi>Ware</hi> with <hi>London.</hi> But S. Mathew writeth of Bethleem as it was to be eſteemed in his dayes, when this propheſie was fulfilled, and Chriſt was borne, and openly known to the world, and ſo in this place he prayſeth it, and preferreth it before the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cities. For if one ſhould haue looked only on the walles, territories, and circuite of this poore towne Bethleem, it would in compariſon of other ſtately and mightily repleniſhed cities of the countrey, appeare a baſe, and mean village. But if we according to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie of the matter, ponder, and conſider the high ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that God vouchſafed it (in that the Meſſias the only ſauiour of the vniuerſal world would be borne in it) we ſhall then in deed ſee, that it is not to be iudged, and eſtemed the leſt, but that of all the cities, euen of the whole world, it only rightly beareth away y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> price, and prayſe, and before all other is to be preferred, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:16253:43"/>
additio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ouerplus, leaſt any thing ſhould lack. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Iewes themſelues did vnderſtande in this place the true Meſſias, which is no other but Ieſus Chriſt: and yet to ſay the truth, it had bene ſufficient, or more then ſufficient to any godly man, that the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt applieth, and appropreateth this to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>¶Furthermore where the Prophet ſayth, that this <hi>Moſchel,</hi> ſhalbe the true gouernour of the Iſraelites: he ſheweth hereby,<note place="margin">Feudatory, is one that holdeth of an other.</note> that this Prince ſhould not be a fuda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, or vaſſall (as the lawyers terme it) but the true Lord, &amp; king of Iſrael, whoſe vaſſayls, nay, ſeruants, Saule, Dauid, Salomon, Roboam, and all the other former kinges were. For <hi>Moſchel</hi> in Ebrew ſignifieth properly, a Monarch, and a mighty pearles Prince, of whome all other do hould, and he of none, but hath euery ſoule ſubiect to him. And laſtly, he geueth vs to vnderſtand, how royall a Lord, and Prince he is: In that he ſayth, <hi>his forth goinges haue bene from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and from euerlaſting:</hi> by which wordes, the Church alwayes vnderſtode the byrth of Chriſt to be from euerlaſting, of the deitye of his heauenly father incomprehenſible, and vnſcrutable. For the Scripture maketh mention of a two fould byrth of Chriſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one is temporall, to wit,<note place="margin">Chriſtes double na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie.</note> when at the determinated tyme he was according to his humanitie, borne true man of the virgin Mary in the Citie of Bethlem: The other eternall according to his deuine nature, without compaſſe of tyme, without beginning, and from euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</p>
                  <p>Both theſe natiuities the prophet here toucheth: &amp; by theſe laſt wordes, he proueth his true diuinitie, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>his forth going &amp;c.</hi> As though he ſhould ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde, and heare O Bethlee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what a kind of Lord thou ſhalt bring forth. Certenly in thee ſhalbe borne a true man: but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his byrth is not his firſt beginning, &amp; ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal. For he was euen alwayes without beginning, before the world was made: nay, before the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the world were layd, euen from euerlaſting.</p>
                  <p>Wherof it truly followeth, that he is true, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall God. For there is no creature without begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but euery one hath his tyme of creation, &amp; takes
<pb facs="tcp:16253:44"/>
his firſt beginning at ſome tyme, before which it was nothing. Now then if his forth going be from before beginning, very well &amp; truly is that thing heare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtod, out of which he went, (to wit) God the father.</p>
                  <p>¶And thus the prophet very playnely, and excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſheweth, that this Prince (according to his nature, in which his forth going was without beginning) is our onely trew, and naturall God, the ſonne of God, which tooke not his originall with tyme, nor had not his beginning, when tyme begon, neyther was made with the world, when it was made: but is as Paule ſayth.<note n="c." place="margin">Col. 1.15.</note> 
                     <hi>The Image of our inuiſible Cod, the firſt borne of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery creature. For by him were all thinges created which are in heauen, and earth, thinges viſible, and inuiſible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all thinges were created by him, and for him, and he is before all thinges, and in him all thinges conſiſt.</hi> And Iohn ſayth.<note n="d." place="margin">Iohn. 1.1</note> 
                     <hi>In the beginning was the word and the word was with God, and the word was God. This was in the beginning with God. by it were all thinges made, and the word became fleſh,</hi> (that is) was borne a naturall trew man.<note place="margin">Baſar.</note> For the Ebrew word <hi>Baſar,</hi> in holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſignifieth, as one wold ſay, the whole man, both in body, and ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt alſo in Iohn ſayth, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes. <note n="e" place="margin">Ioh. 8.58.</note> 
                     <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay vnto you, before Abraham was, I am.</hi> And here mark that he ſayd not, <hi>I was:</hi> but, <hi>I am.</hi> In the which phraſe of ſpeech he would ſignify vnto them his eternall, and deuine nature. For the ſtate of all creatures is ſuch, that at one tyme, or other, they are made, and haue their beginning, and are limited, and bordered with ſome end of tyme. And the tyme alſo was, in whiche the creature yet was not, and when it was not made: there was alſo a tyme when it was made: as Abraham was not in the tyme of Noye, but he was in the tyme of Melchiſedeck. But with God it is farre otherwiſe. For the Godhead is vnmeſurable, infinite, and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyng: it can not be comprehended, nor conteyned in tyme, and of tyme, which vaniſheth, periſheth, paſſeth and ſlippeth away and neuer ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth in ſtay. The god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head hath no former, nor latter tyme, no tyme paſt, nor
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16253:44"/>
no tyme to come, as the creature hath: and therefore Chriſt ſpeaketh of his deuine, and eternall nature, in that one word, or ſyllable of the preſent tyme, ſaying, <hi>I am.</hi> For in deed, eternitie is for euer, and hath neyther former, nor latter tyme, beginning, nor ending.</p>
                  <p>The vacabond, and vnbeleuing Iewes ſuppoſed, &amp; iudged that he was no more but bare man, and ſuch a one, as Abraham, or Elias was: neither could they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide to heare the myſteries of Chriſtes wordes, or giue credite to them. They dreamingly thought it could not be poſſible, that he ſhould haue ſeene Abraham, ſeyng it was ful two thouſand yeares, and more, betwixt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams departure out of the world, and Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the fleſh into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world: neither did they know, or vnderſtande the ſcriptures, which teache and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhew, that Meſſias ſhould not only be borne in Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leem in tyme: but alſo that his forth going was before all tyme, as Paul teſtifieth to the Hebrues, ſaying: <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt yeſterday, and to day,</hi> 
                     <note n="f." place="margin">Heb. 13.8.</note> 
                     <hi>and the ſame alſo euen for euer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here then if you will well waigh this propheſie, you maie ſee in it, both the death and reſurrection of Chriſt, which neceſſarily is to be required, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee might raigne and rule eternally, and ſpiritually. For in as much as it was determined, that he ſhould be borne of the ſtocke of Dauid, a perfect, and very natural man in the citie of Bethleem: it was not to be thought ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, though he ſhould dye, as well as Dauid, Salomon, &amp; other men did. What meruail is it (I pray you) to ſee a naturall man die? certainly the corporal, or vitall life can not alway indure. Neuertheleſſe, for all that, in as much as he ſhould be the true, and chiefe Lord of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, it can not be, that he ſhould be ſubiect to death, or y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> death ſhould vanquiſh, or deteyne him: but that of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity he muſt riſe agayne from death, &amp; liue for euer.</p>
                  <p>And therfore is he compelled by temporall death, to leaue his mortall lyfe: for how can mortall man come to immortalitie, leaſt firſt he put of his mortall body, which can not be done, but by corporal death. And thus it behoued him to change this frayle, corporal, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible lyfe, into a ſpirituall, inuiſible, immortall, and
<pb facs="tcp:16253:45"/>
incorruptible lyfe, that he might become the true, and euerlaſting Lord of all the Iſraelites, as well, of thoſe that before had bene, as of thoſe, that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, at any tyme ſhould be: and that he might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo begin his true, eternall, and ſpirituall kingdome: the adminiſtration whereof, is not after the maner of men, nor yet conſiſteth in worldly matters. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Iohn ſayth:<note n="g" place="margin">Ioh. 12.24.</note> 
                     <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay vnto you, except the wheat corne fall into the ground, and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.</hi>

                  <p>WHen <hi>Pekah,</hi> the king of the ten tribes, which fell away in Iſraell, and <hi>Rezin</hi> the king of Syria, made warre vpon Achas the fifteenth king of Iuda, &amp; murthered, and ſpoyled the inhabitantes of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, purpoſing, and determining to remoue Achas, &amp; place an other in his kingdome: then the holy ghoſt (while theſe two kings with detrune<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and bloodſhed, had all to defaced the land of Iuda) propheſied, by the Prophet Eſay,<note n="a" place="margin">Eſay. 7.14.</note> 
                     <hi>Of the bleſſed Virgine Mary, that ſhe ſhould beare the child Chriſt.</hi> And although thoſe kings were very cruell vpon Achas, and were both mightily and maruelous bloudily bent againſt him: yet did not God for all that ſuffer them to preuayle againſt him, and his poore tribe of Iuda, becauſe he would faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perform, and pay that which he had promiſed to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, euen that Meſſias ſhould come of his houſe, and lynage. He comforteth therfore Achas y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king in this perill, purpoſing to quicken and confirme his faith by this miracle, to the ende he ſhould not feare his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. For God promiſed, that he himſelfe would ayde him. But Achas was an Idolater, and an hypocrite, neither did he receyue that for a ſigne of Gods helpe. Wherfore God reiected that wicked king, and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe publiſhed the myracle, and gaue the ſigne to the houſe of Dauid, which was the ſigne of true helpe, and deliuerance from the horrible, and euerlaſting ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, and miſery, wherin all we were wrapped, euen death, damnation, and the tiranny of Sathan.

                     <hi>Haalmah <hi>(or a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin) ſhall conceiue, and beare a ſonne, and his name ſhall be called Emanuel, or Immanuel.</hi>
                     </hi> Loe, here you ſee, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he propheſieth of the Virgin Mary, and her ſonne Chriſt our Sauiour. And here the holy ghoſt telleth vs, that Meſſias ſhould not be borne (after the maner of all the other ſonnes of Adam) of the ſeed of man, but onely of
<pb facs="tcp:16253:46"/>
the pure, and vndefiled virgin Mary. And therfore, his birth is not as ours is: vncleane, defiled, and infected: but holy, pure, and free from all blemiſh of ſinne. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is that bleſſed ſeed of Abraham by which one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and by no other, all we wretched children of Adam (conceiued and borne in ſinne) muſt be clenſed, bleſſed, ſanctified, &amp; iuſtified fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all the filthines of our ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, the wordes of this propheſie do plainly paynt out the maner of his conception, ſignifiyng that he was not conceyued of mans ſeede, but that Mary onely, by the vertue of the holy ghoſt, conceiued. For here is promiſed that a child ſhould be borne, and yet the mother remayne a pure virgin. And yet here is no mention of any father, becauſe it might bee a famous ſigne and miracle.<note place="margin">Luke. 1.31.</note> The Archangell Gabriel did rightly expound this propheſie in Luke. For, after he had ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Mary, he ſayd: <hi>Loe, thou ſhalt conceiue in thy wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be, and beare a ſonne, and ſhalt call his name Ieſus.

                  <p>This by the gift and grace of God, I beleue conſtantly. Neyther do I doubt, but that Chriſt was borne of a pure and chaſte virgin, ſeyng the holy ghoſt himſelfe doth beare witnes of the ſame.<note place="margin">Math. 1.</note> And S Math. alledgeth this place out of the ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th chapter of Eſay, &amp; interpreteth this Ebrue word <hi>Haalmah,</hi> Virgin: which interpreter we both ought, and may certaynely beleue.</p>
                  <p>But, whereas that faithles, and obſtinate people the Iewes, enemies to Chriſt, exclaime, ſaying that <hi>Haal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah</hi> doth not ſignify a virgin, but a maid, or yong wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man alredy maried to a man: and whereas they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the virginitie of Mary, and falſly accuſe it, as fayned: and ſeyng they alſo wraſt this propheſie other wayes, then to Mary, (according as our frend <hi>Rabbi Antonius Margarita</hi> tolde vs) I pray you let me heare
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:16253:46"/>
how, theſe falſe Iewes may be refuted, and conuinced out of the old teſtament: For they deny the autoritie &amp; teſtimony of the new.</p>

                  <p>The Iewes (as vtter enemies to the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the goſpell) obiect in deed many thinges agaynſt this propheſy, but al without ground, and reaſon. But that you may better vnderſtand the meaning of this propheſie, I will firſt expound vnto you certaine He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue wordes, and cleare the controuerſie in ſome prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall pointes, wherof the ground of the controuerſie doth depend. The Iewes haue three wordes, which ſignify maydes: the firſt is <hi>Naerah,</hi> which ſignifieth a yong woman, mayd, or no mayd. For, as Rabbi <hi>Liz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hak Nathan</hi> teſtifieth, the true ſignification of this word is generally, Youth.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond word is <hi>Bthulah,</hi> which (as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi ſayth) ſignifieth, a pure ſhamefaſt virgin.</p>
                  <p>The third worde is <hi>Haalmah,</hi> which in this place the prophet vſeth of Mary, as moſt proper and fit for the purpoſe. For it ſignifieth a virgine, whoſe virginitie is pure and vntouched, but ripe, marigeable, and able to beare children. And it is worthy the obſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that this worde is neuer taken in holy ſcripture for a yong woman that hath knowen a man. This alſo is as well worth noting, that <hi>Haalmah</hi> doth not ſignifie generally euery mayd, which is pure, and vntouched:<note place="margin">Keepe in your yong maydens if you will haue them vertuous <hi>Haalmah<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </hi> as the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mary was.</note> but (as S. Hierome noteth) a virgin cloſe kept in, whom the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents diligently, carefully, and watchfully retayne and kepe in at home. This may be gathered of the worde <hi>Schoreſth.</hi> For <hi>Alam</hi> ſignifieth to hide, couer, &amp; keepe out of ſight. And ſo is Mary called <hi>haalmah:</hi> not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe was a pure and vndefiled virgin, but becauſe the yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g mayd which is diligently and vigilantly kept vp of her parents, is for the moſt part godly, and holily brought vp, &amp; vertuouſly inſtructed. And the Prophet could not haue vſed a worde more to the purpoſe, and fitter for this place, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this word <hi>Haalmah,</hi> which moſt properly agreeth with Mary. For <hi>Bthulah</hi> ſignifieth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently any mayde, as well yonger, as older, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe be fit for child bearing or not. There be many maydes well ſtriken in age, of threeſcore, or threeſcore
<pb facs="tcp:16253:47"/>
and ten yeres old, and ſo vnfit for to beare children: but the prophet would here declare, and ſet forth a virgin, both yong, marigeable, and fruitfull.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Iewes all without reaſon, ſtanding v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no ground, but only deſirous to make braule, being in hart obſtinately, impudently, and wilfully blynded, and hardened, cauill, and falſly ſay, that <hi>haalmah</hi> ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a yong woman, which in mariage hath already known a man. But they may be conuinced, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued liers out of the olde teſtament: In which, <hi>haalmah</hi> neuer ſignifieth a yong woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that hath had the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of man, but only a pure, chaſt, and vndefiled vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.<note place="margin">Gen. 24.43.

                  <p>CHriſt in the holy ſcriptures hath many names, and all of them moſt ſweete and comfortable, as is this Emanuel, of which you heard euen now out of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth of Eſay. But there be two eſpecial &amp; chief names which the ſcripture giueth him,<note place="margin">Ieſus is a comfortable name.</note> which we wil firſt ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. The former of them is Ieſus, a name moſt proper, and agreeing with him, and moſt comfortable to vs. This name is an Hebrue word: for the Hebrues ſay, that <hi>Ieſchuah,</hi> or <hi>Iehoſchuah,</hi> is as much to ſay, as health, a ſauiour, or keeper, and it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of the worde <hi>Iaſcha,</hi> which is, ſaued, or deliuered, or els it may come of <hi>Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia,</hi> that is, he hath ſaued, kept, or deliuered. This roi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all or glorious name agreeth not with any ſo truely &amp; fitly, as with Chriſt. He iuſtly in deed, and by good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert is honoured, and called by this name: for he onely it is, that deliuereth and ſaueth vs from all calamities, both temporall and eternall.</p>
                  <p>And thus doth the Angell interprete this name in Mathew, where he ſayeth to Ioſeph.<note n="a." place="margin">Math. 1.20.</note> 
                     <hi>Ioſeph, thou ſonne of Dauid, feare not to take Mary for thy wyfe: for that which is conceiued in her, is of the holy ghoſt: ſhe ſhall bring forth a ſonne, and thou ſhalt call his name Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, for he ſhal ſaue his people from their ſinnes.</hi> And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Hanna the high prieſt, and Caiphas, and Ioanne, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the prieſts, aſked Peter and Iohn in the Actes, by what power, and in what name they helped the lame man: <note n="b." place="margin">Acts. 4.6.</note>
                     <hi>Peter anſwered by the name of Ieſus Chriſt of Nazareth.</hi> For in deede there is none other name vnder heauen giuen vnto men, in which we can, or muſt be ſaued.</p>

                  <p>The high prieſt in that place is only a figure of Chriſt, and therefore hath he this name giuen him. For Ioſua the ſonne of Nun,<note place="margin">Ioſua. 1.1.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:16253:50"/>
and increaſed them maruelouſly by theſe mens meanes, yet were they all but only temporall, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtriall giftes, which they receyued of God by theyr handes, and very trifles in deed, in compariſon of the great giftes, and benefits, helth, and helpe, which God through Ieſus Chriſt hath now giuen, not to one peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple only, but to all the world. For Chriſt deliuereth vs from eternall miſery, from ſinne, from death, and from euerlaſting damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and giueth vs innocency, helth, lyfe, and eternall ſaluation. This name therfore filleth heauen, and earth with vnſpeakeable ioy, becauſe by this name commeth true, and preſent helpe in all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and certain ſaluation from all calamities: As Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſayth in the Acts. <note n="a." place="margin">Acts. 10.43.</note> 
                     <hi>To him giue all the Prophets wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that through his name all that beleue, ſhall receyue remiſſion of ſinnes.</hi> To conclude, this in deede is true helpe, true lyfe, and true liberty.</p>
                  <p>What I pray you is the ayde, &amp; helpe of all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, and worldly creatures, in compariſon of this? can they deliuer a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any ſinne? can they giue any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall lyfe? can they ſaue ones lyfe? or rayſe one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deth? or deliuer one from the deuill? a fig they can? But our Chriſt only is he that can helpe the world, neither can he only, but alſo will, &amp; doth that which he can. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he only, and none other is that true Ieſus, which both in body, and ſoule, and in lyfe, and death helpeth, aydeth, deliuereth, and with eternall lyfe bleſſeth all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> beleue in him.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:16253:52"/>
For they had heard ſo much of Meſſias in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcriptures, that they had conceiued a good, and certayn hope, and doubted not but that at his commyng, they ſhould be deliuered from thoſe perils, calamities, diſcommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and violences, which they ſuffred: and from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iniuries, and euils, which either publikely, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately vexed them: And they hoped alſo, that al things ſhould, after the comming of Meſſias, goe well with them, ſo that they, &amp; all theirs ſhould haue a moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and proſperous ſtate, euen a world of wealth, and a flowing ſea of all felicitie: As it may euidently be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered of the womans wordes of Samaria in the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Iohn, which ſayd to Chriſt. <note n="o." place="margin">Ioh. 4.2</note>

                  <p>Conſider now here with your ſelfe how great, true, pure, and precious comfort we may take of theſe two names of Chriſt. <hi>Ieſus,</hi> ſignifieth ſaluation, or a ſauior: or els importeth the ſame that the worde, God, doth.<note place="margin">Chriſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed.</note> And <hi>Chriſt</hi> or <hi>Meſſias,</hi> is as much to ſay, as annoynted. For there is vnderſtood in this name, the vnction of grace, and mercy, which God promiſed vnto vs in his ſonne. And now what would we more? what can we wiſh more? or what need we more? nay, what is there that we haue not, if we be once annointed with this oyntment. For if we conſtantly beleue, and be thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwaded, that God hath giuen vs Chriſt to be our prieſt, and our king, to the ende he may be our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, conſolation, iuſtification, and redemption, then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly it muſt be as we beleue: Becauſe he hath firmly promiſed that he will do it, if we beleue it.

                  <p>THis article in deede is worthy to be diligently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and well vnderſtood.

                  <p>At this day alſo the Iewes retayne theſe, and much more doltiſh dreames, and fantaſies of Meſſias. For oftentymes at <hi>Ratiſbone</hi> and other places I haue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted with them of Meſſias and his kingdome: But I could neuer here any thing of them, but mere doltiſh dreames, carnall imaginations, and ridiculous fooliſh fables. S.

                  <p>But it is no maruell to ſee them, which are thus wrapped in darkenes, &amp; bewitched with all madneſſe, fowly and fooliſhly erre:<note place="margin">The church.</note> ſeing they neither be, nor can abide to be in the catholike church of Chriſt, in which onely, and els not, the holy ghoſt doth reueale vnto me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vnderſtanding, and true meaning of the ſcriptures.

But the Scripture ſpeaketh of much more excellent, high, and glorious things, then is any Iudea or Ieruſalem, though it were of Iemmes or beaten gold. The Prophets with their ſpirituall eyes looked farre aboue this world,<note place="margin">2.

In which deadly daunger, grieuous perill, and great calamitie, man was ſo blynded, ſo farre paſt vnderſtanding, and
<pb facs="tcp:16253:57"/>
ſo ignorant, that he would not acknowledge his miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and wretched ſtate, neither ſee the preſent daunger of euerlaſting death,<note place="margin">The mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; blind<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of our nature.</note> nor yet deſire, helpe, counſayle, or remedy: But would (ſuch was his madnes, ſecuritie &amp; blindnes) haue taried bondſlaue in the tiranny of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and died captiue to the deuil, if this our king be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moued with mercy towardes his people ſtanding in ſuch danger, had not preſently helped vs. He ſaw y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we could not deliuer our ſelues out of this kingdome of ſinne, neither ſhake of that cruell tiranny of ſathan: and that the deuill through his great might &amp; ſtrength would haue ouercommed vs, and ſo haue poſſeſſed his palace in peace, becauſe that in man there was no ſuch ſtrength, no ſuch force, no ſuch ſubtletie, neyther any ſuch deuiſe, that he could wynd himſelfe out of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery wherin he was wrapped. Wherfore, Chriſt ſeyng this &amp; taking compaſſion of this our miſerable ſtate, came downe to vs, that he might deliuer vs out of this bondage and thraldome, and ſet vs at liberty.</p>
                  <p>We neuer deſired, nor required him, neither did our deſerts moue him. What ſay I? did we moue or deſire him to come? nay, our hartes could not once thinke of him, nor deſire his helpe, or comfort: ſuch was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes wherin we were drowned. We came not, we fled not for helpe to him of our ſelues, for nothing was ſo farre paſt our reach. We could do nothing leſſe, it was not in our abilitie, ſuch was the corruption of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſuch, ſo darke, and ſo dimme cloudes of depraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion poſſeſſed our myndes. No, no, this our king came to vs, for we neither, could, nor would go to him. The cauſe why he came, and what he doth with vs, what profite he brought vs, and how nedefull it was that he ſhould come to vs, the Prophet addeth, ſaying: <hi>He co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the iuſt and ſaued,</hi> or, <hi>he commeth vnto the iuſt, and a ſauiour.</hi> This is that great ioy, this is the cauſe of our reioycing, and triumphing. We were through our ſinnes, wicked, and guilty of all iniquity, and defiled with all kinde of vice, wickednes and impiety, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned to euerlaſting death, and adiudged to eternall damnation, and yet could we not helpe, or quite our ſelues from it. But Chriſt our king commeth to vs: he
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:16253:57"/>
bringeth vs ſaluation, and he iuſtifieth, and deliuereth vs from all dangers.</p>
                  <p>This our king was not only iuſt, innocent,<note place="margin">Chriſt righ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teous and iuſt, for our ſakes, and to our vſe.</note> and free from all offence and ſpot, for, and concerning himſelfe onely: but he giueth alſo his righteouſnes, and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency to vs. In ſo much that through him we are cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted righteous before God, if we beleue in him, as Paul ſayth: <note n="b." place="margin">Rom. 3.26.</note> 
                     <hi>he onely is iuſt, and iuſtifieth others.</hi> This word iuſt, muſt not here be vnderſtoode to be that exact and perfect iuſtice, by which God iudgeth the wicked,<note place="margin">Iuſt.</note> and puniſheth the hard harted. For, this ſeuere iuſtice doth ſore afray vs poore ſinners and offenders againſt god. Yea it bringeth heuines &amp; vexatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hart, &amp; driueth vs to deſperatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neither doth it any thing leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> worke ioy, gladnes, and reioycing in vs. But the Scripture vſeth for comforte ſake, to call Chriſt, iuſt, or righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. as well in the olde as new teſtament. For he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among all the ſonnes of men is iuſt and righteous, and ſo iuſt and righteous, that thorough him alone, we are counted before God, iuſt, innocent, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</p>

Neither findeth he any helpe, counſell, comfort, or remedy, either in the world, or worldly creatures, vnleſſe he be ſprinckled with the bloud of this new teſtament (that is) vnleſſe he beleue, that Chriſt (as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpell teacheth) hath ſhed his bloud to pacify Gods anger for his ſinnes, and waſh them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. This if the ſinner beleue, then is he thorow that fayth by which he beleueth that Chriſt ſhed his bloud for his ſinnes, deliuered out of that lake, to wit, his conſcience, and he hath comfort and reioyceth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lord.

But he could not haue deliuered his ſeruantes from death, if he had continued ſtill in death. And therefore it was needfull that he ſhould riſe agayne from death, and va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh and ouercome death.

                  <p>Now then you ſee in this propheſie, that Chriſtes conuerſation at his former comming,<note place="margin">Chriſtes former com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ming.</note> ſhould not bee ſtately, or lofty, but lowly, contemptible, humble, and modeſt. For there was nothing to be ſeen in him, but gentlenes towards poore ſinners, with much miſery, grieuous calamitie, great ſtormes, and heauy burdens of perſecutions, afflictions, &amp; tribulations, yea &amp; at the laſt, death it ſelf, all which he ſuffred for our ſakes.

And although he was mighty (as Eſay doth call him) which could deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer himſelfe and others out of all danger: yet in all the tyme of his being here vpon earth, he would not ſhew his might, ſtrength and power: but became weake and poore, as the Iewes (flouting him vpon the croſſe) ſaid in the goſpell of Mathew,<note place="margin">Math. 27.41.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>Here Eſay deſcribeth the perſon of Chriſt, and telleth what his conuerſation ſhould be here in this earth, all the tyme of his trauaile in his office or miniſtery: how he ſhould take vpon him our ſinnes: how he ſhould ſatiſfy for our faultes: and how he ſhould with all gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenes and mercy, vſe vs poore wretches which deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued nothing but payne, and puniſhment: and how he ſhould ſo entierly loue vs, that no man need be afrayd of him, dread him, or tremble at the preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of him.

                  </p>
                  <p>Is not this now a wonderful, incredible, and great ſubmiſſion and humility?

                  <p>If at this his comming he had ſhewed himſelf lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke, and had come in the mighty power and greatnes of his godhead, and had vſed and ſhewed his might, &amp; maieſty, where ſhould we poore wretches &amp; miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſinners haue appeared? whither ſhould we haue fled? or with what face could we now approch, &amp; come ſo often into his ſight, ſeyng we ſo oftentymes offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, and know ſo much euill by our ſelues? but now ſeing he commeth in ſuch humility like a ſeruant, and ſheweth ſuch humblenes, modeſty, and gentlenes in his perſon, may not we hope to receue of him grace and forgiuenes of our ſinnes, yea, although we were drowned in a moſt deepe whirle poole of ſinne, and though we were guilty of neuer ſo much wickedneſſe? Truly this ſeruice of Chriſt, is to God a moſt delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, acceptable, and precious ſeruice, which he greatly eſtemeth, and deliteth moſt to haue offred vnto him.</p>
                  <p>And this order Paul kepeth in preaching Chriſt.

                  <p>Eſay doth paſſing wel, and plainly here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe Chriſt, and better in deed then tong can vtter, &amp; in ſuch wordes, as wherof a man may conceiue eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all comfort. Goe to then, as you deſire, let vs examine euery word particularly. Where as the Prophet ſayth in the perſon of Chriſt. <hi>The ſpirit of the Lord is vpon me:</hi> He ſignifieth, that he was conſecrated, annoynted, and ordred of his heauenly father, to be our prieſt and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, that we ſhould not doubt, but whatſoeuer Chriſt ſayth and doth, it is the word, &amp; deed of the holy ghoſt.
<pb facs="tcp:16253:70"/>
And then he ſayth: <hi>Therefore the Lorde hath annointed me.</hi> Kings and prieſts in the law were choſen, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to their offices by annointing. Wherfore it was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which annoynting, the Prophet ſpeaketh in the Pſalmes. But to the ende we might knowe what kynde of oin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng that was, and what a king &amp; prieſt Chriſt ſhould be, he addeth, <hi>To preach good tidings vnto the poore, &amp; to comfort all that mourne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the Iewes, beyng deluded by that fanaticall ſpirit, conceiued a vayne &amp; foliſh opinion of their Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias, to wit, that he ſhould come with a worldly traine, in corporal magnificence, and princely pompe, after the maner of earthly kings: and that he ſhould be feareful to his foes, and raign corporally here on the earth, and geue the Iewes ſuch aboundance of worldly goodes, that they ſhould exceede in all pleaſure, wallow in all corporal welth, &amp; be lordes of al the earth, &amp;c. Such an one is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iues Chriſt, &amp; no dout a goodly trim Chriſt. And yet are not the Iewes alone in this error, but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome alſo at this day, which in name are called chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but not Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in dede, are deceued w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this fa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſy. For now that Chriſt is brought to light, &amp; the doctrine of the goſpell euery where known, many are found yet ſo fleſhly harted, that they ſeeke and looke for nothyng els in Chriſt and the goſpel, but worldly wealth, ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, eaſe, quietnes, dignities, honours, and abundance of all things. And ſo playing the Iewes, deuiſe vnto themſelues a Iewiſh and carnall Chriſt, which ſhould here in earth, only, giue them pleaſures and worldly wealth:<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.26.</note> as the Capernites did in Iohn which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſt only, for the feding and filling of their bellies. They regarded not fayth nor heauenly riches, which are the giftes that Chriſt ſpecially doth giue. And ſo do our vagabonds now a dayes with vs, which onely gape and hunt for other mens meat, and ſeke nothing but eaſe.

But if they know any fautors &amp; louers of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haſt them, ſaying thus with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues: We ſhall now be well: here ſhall we get both eaſe and maintenaunce: here ſhall we ſcrape vp ſo much mony as will find vs, that we need not labour: we wil deſire theſe godly mens ayde and almes. We ſhall not ſurely (ſay they) want their helpe, they wil beſtow their libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie vpon vs. For the goſpel teacheth loue, which is liberall, and bountifull and always ready, and bent to helpe, and ſupport euery man.

And thus vnder the pretence of religion they deceiue many good men which thinke themſelues of duety bound to helpe them, both with their goods and bodies and all that they can, miniſtring vnto them, both meat, mony, and apparell.<note place="margin">Falſe Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers.</note> This kinde of people creepe into all places where the goſpell is taught, and they loue it for none other cauſe, but only for the maintenance of theyr idle lyfe. If it were not, that vnder pretence of the Goſpel, they can fill their bellies, they would vtterly deſpiſe it, and ſpit at it. And here I ſpeake no vntruth. I knowe what I writ. I haue knowen many which haue bene robbed of much mony by theſe ſmelfeaſts &amp; gredy goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers, which vnder pretence of the goſpel, onely for the belly ſake and eaſe, falſly profeſſe themſelues to be religious.

And yet wil they not be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with an indifferent good almes, but craue (as it were of due) ſometyme mony, ſometyme victuals, and ſometyme one thing, and ſometyme an other: and by this their importunate begging, fill their bagges.

For, the law onely ſheweth and reueleth ſinnes, but it taketh them not away, but leaueth them ſtill in our remembraunce. And where ſinnes be, there death hath dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there is tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling, feare, horror, heauines, and deſperation, ſo long as the conſcience, which is the place of torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and ſtorehouſe of ſinne, is diſquieted, and feareth death. Such then as feele their ſinnes, are the contrite in hart, and moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted of all men: theſe ſee their miſery, calamity, and danger: but to heale themſelues, and to deliuer them ſelues out of ſuch danger and miſeries, they are of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in no wiſe able. But when as Chriſt commeth accompanied with the healthfull preaching, &amp; doctrine of the goſpell, then commeth their comfort, and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Becauſe the goſpell offreth and frely giueth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes of ſinnes, true holines, &amp; euerlaſting lyfe to all that faithfully beleue. For thus it ſayth, ſpeaking vnto the poore ſinner: If thou be a ſinner, if thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience be troubled, if thou be afraid of deth, &amp; if thou feare gods iudgement, marke what thou muſt do. Fly vnto Chriſt who only can, and wil of his own good wil, ſaue and deliuer thee. For to this end, God the father ſent hym. Beleue in him, &amp; for his ſake all thy ſinnes ſhalbe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen thee. For he tooke thy ſinnes vpon him, &amp; he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred and ſatiſfied for them. When thou haſt thus done, then is thy conſcience, mery, pacified, and quieted. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath thorow fayth taken holde of Chriſt, who hath taken away the hand writing of an euill conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,<note place="margin">None need feare or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre for his ſinns.</note> which was altogether againſt vs, miſerably tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented vs, greuouſly vexed vs, &amp; daily diſturbed our peace, and hath blotted it out, &amp; nayled it to his croſſe,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:16253:73"/>
ſo that there is no cauſe why the man that beleueth in Chriſt ſhould quake, tremble, or feare for his ſinnes, or ſhould flie from God as a ſeuere iudge. For God is now become fauourable vnto him, and hath forgiuen him all his ſinnes for Chriſt his ſake, in whom he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leueth. And this faith in Chriſt bringeth preſent helpe, and conſolation to the penitent hart: it comforteth and ſtrengtheneth the man that before was diſmayed: ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> now he may plainly know, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God for Chriſts ſake, wil not herafter be a ſeuere, &amp; fearful iudge vnto him: but a louing, mercyful, and tender Father. And this is the true, and perfect binding vp, and healing, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of ſick, wounded, and feeble harts. For, the hart neuer findeth true, and ſound comfort, grace, and life, but in Chriſt Ieſu.</p>

                  <p>It followeth: <hi>To the captiues freedome.</hi> By the word of God it is playne, that we are ſinners, and that we are as it were,<note place="margin">We be pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawe, till Chriſt delyuer vs.</note> caſt into a priſon, or iaile, from whence ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the force of nature, nor by all the good workes in the world, we can deliuer, and ſaue our ſelues. We ought in deede to leade pure, and vnſpotted lyues, and ſtill to be doing good, and flye from euill: and the law requireth the ſame at our hands: but our ſinful na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is ſlow to good, and farre from fulfilling the law, and maketh vs liue according to our carnall deſires, and concupiſcens, which euen from our youth vp is al wayes bent, and ready to euell.

all that we doe with vncleane, and filthy hartes.

Wherefore, their mourning, and ſorrow vaniſheth, and in place

therof commeth comfort, and conſolation. And as they were in vnbeleef (before they receiued the goſpel) wild, crooked, vnprofitable, and barrain trees of vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes,<note place="margin">Hier. 17.6.</note> and, as Ieremy ſaith, <hi>Wild brambles, heth in the wildernes, or buſhes in the deſert,</hi> the vnfruitfull ground of this world:<note place="margin">The opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith</note> So, by faith of the Goſpel, and this conſolation, they ſhalbe moſt pleaſant, and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful trees planted by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water ſide, which take ſuch deep roote in this moyſture, that, though euen the greateſt heate of tempation ſhould aſſail them, yet doe they not feare, fade, or fall away, but their leaues floriſh ſtil, and are green, and wyther not in the dangerous drought, or ſcorching heat of ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer, but in their due time bring forth their fruit.

                  <p>It would be long to rehearſe all that this Prophet onely hath propheſied of the miniſtery, and humility of Chriſt, in his former co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, &amp; there be many things alſo ſpoken of this matter in other places, and titles of Chriſt?

                     <hi>And, after threeſcore, and two weekes, ſhall <hi>Meſsiah</hi> be ſlayn, and ſhal haue nothing, and the people of the Prince that ſhall come, ſhall deſtroy the Citie, and the

Sanctuary, and the end thereof ſhalbe with a floud: and vnto the end of the battaile, it ſhall be deſtroyed by deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations: and he ſhal confirme the couenant with many, for one weeke: and in the middeſt of the weeke, he ſhall cauſe the Sacrifice of the oblation, to ceaſe, and there ſhall be in the Temple, abhomination, and deſolation.</hi> Or (on the winges, or at the winges, ſhall ſtand abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of deſolation,) and that deſolation, <hi>ſhall continue vnto the end, or conſummation of all thinges.</hi> Or, (it is decreed, that deſolation ſhall contynue vnto the end.</p>
                  <p>This Propheſie is ſomething darke, and it is vnderſtood, and expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded diuerſly, both of the Iewes, and Chriſtians. And therfore, muſt we in intreating, and expounding of it, beſtow the more tyme. And worthy it is dilygently to be handled. For it is one of the chefeſt, and notableſt Propheſies that we haue of Chriſt. So great miſteryes of our God, Chriſt Ieſu, doth it open vnto vs. I will therefore ſet downe the ſame in certayn Articles.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all, muſt be noted, that the Prophet Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyell propheſyed this in the captiuitye of Babylon, when Nabuchodonizor the king of Babylon, had led away the Tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hier. 25.11</note> into <hi>Chaldaea,</hi> and the Iewes were captiues ſeuenty yeares, of which, Ieremy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſyed.</p>
                  <p>In this captiuity, the Iewes were much vexed, and troubled. For this was their greateſt, and heauy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt croſſe, that, being amongſt the wicked <hi>Goim,</hi> (the <hi>Gentils</hi>) they were commaunded to lay away the true worſhip of God, which is ſet down in his word. As appeareth in the Pſalmes: where the Iewes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, and witnes their heauynes, ſaying: <hi>g. <hi>By the Ryuers of Babylon we ſate, and there we wept when we remembred Syon.</hi>
                     </hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 1 37.1</note> 
                     <hi>We hanged our harps vpon the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes in the middes therof. Then, they that led vs Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, required of vs ſongs, and mirth, when we had han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vp our harps, ſaying: Sing vs one of the ſonges of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. How ſhal we ſing (ſayd we) a ſong of the Lord, in a ſtrange land?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In theſe afflictions, &amp; miſeries, Daniel began to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fes
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:16253:77"/>
his owne ſinnes, and the ſinnes of his people, and to pray hartily euery day to God for his captiues: that for his mercy ſake, he would vouchſafe to pardon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their offences, for which they were led away captiues: and that he would helpe them, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> being come into theyr own land, they might reſtore the true worſhip of god, which had bene ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g neglected. Daniel praying thus, is heard, and the Archangell Gabriel is ſent vnto him, who ſhewed the tyme appointed,<note place="margin">Gala. 4.4.</note> or <hi>fulneſſe of tyme</hi> (as Paul calleth it) to wit, the tyme of Meſſias, in which Chriſt ſhould come, and bring with him all ioy, &amp; true happines. He told alſo the number of yeares, to wit, how long it ſhould be to the former comming of Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias, in which he ſhould come into the world, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily begin his euerlaſting kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Secondly here is to be noted, that the former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt was two wayes reuealed vnto Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el. Firſt a farre of, and ſomething darkely (to wit) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what Monarchy of the world, Chriſt ſhould come. Afterward, more nigh and plainely, and ſo perfectly, that he might wel know the very yere in which Chriſt ſhould begin his kingdome. For Daniel by the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the holy ghoſt, expoundeth to the king Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchodonizer, a wonderfull and maruelous dreame of the foure Monarchies, or kingdomes of the world, to wit, of the golden, ſiluer, braſen, and iron kingdome. But that you may the better vnderſtand theſe things, know you that God told Daniel that there ſhould be foure kingdomes or Monarchies in the earth, which ſhould continue vnto the ende of the world, to wit, that all earthly power ouer Kings, Princes, Dukes, Barons, and other magiſtrates ſhould foure tymes be changed, and giuen to ſundry nations. Theſe are thoſe foure Monarchies or kingdoms.<note place="margin">The 4. Monarchs of the world.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt is the Aſſyrian and Babylonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Monarch, in Aſſyria, and Chaldea.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, the Perſians and Medes, in Perſia and Media.</p>
                  <p>The third, the Grecians or Macedonians in Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia.</p>
                  <p>The fourth and laſt (in which Chriſt ſhould come, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:16253:78"/>
the world ſhould haue his end) be the Romans. Theſe foure Empires or Monarchies, are alſo reueled in the <hi>7.</hi> chap. of Daniel by foure beaſts, of the which the firſt is a Lion, the next a Beare, the third a Leopard, the fourth a terrible beaſt without name, hauing iro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> teeth. Thus ſayth Daniel in his <hi>2.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 2.44.</note> chap. <hi>And in the dayes of theſe kings ſhal the God of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſet vp a kingdom which ſhall neuer be deſtroyed, and this kingdome ſhall not bee giuen to an other people: but it ſhall breake, and deſtroy all theſe kingdomes, and it ſhall ſtand for euer. Where as thou ſaweſt that the ſtone was cut of the mountaine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the braſſe, the clay, the ſiluer, and the golde, ſo the great God hath ſhewed the king what ſhall come to paſſe hereafter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this propheſie, is the tyme prefigured in which Meſſias would come and begin his kingdome by his Goſpell and holy ſpirit. Firſt, in an humble &amp; baſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite,<note place="margin">Chriſt is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtone cut out of the mountayne without hands.</note> but afterward at his latter comming, in glory and power. S. Hierome vpon this text ſayth, that in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of theſe kingdomes, a ſtone (that is our lord and ſaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt) was cut fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the mountaine without hands (that is) he was borne of the virgin Mary without the ſeed of man. Wherefore it is manifeſt, that Meſſias in his former comming in great humilitie, would not come in the fleſh and begin his kingdome, before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt Monarchy which is the Romains Empery. For Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel ſayth in the dayes of thoſe kingdoms, that is, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the three firſt Monarchies be ended, and the fourth &amp; laſt (that is, the Romaine Monarchy) doth floriſh and rule the roſte, and when it is toſſed and troubled with tumults, then ſhall the kingdome of Chriſt be erected and begunne, and it ſhall deſtroy the Romiſh empire. But it is to wit, Chriſtes kingdom ſhal abide for euer. All other kingdomes of the world haue their borders limited, and their dayes numbred, which beyng expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the kingdoms decay and come to naught. But that great and mighty kingdome of Chriſt ſhall haue no end, it ſhall neuer be diſſolued, but ſhall abide for euer and euer,<note place="margin">Chriſt is king of all nations. Dan. 2.34.</note> neither ſhall it be in a part or corner of the world, as in Europe, Affrike, or Aſia, but in the whole world. As Daniel witneſſeth, where he ſpeaketh of the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:16253:78"/>
image that Nabuchadonizer ſaw, ſaying: <hi>Thou behel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt it, till a ſtone was cutte (of the mountayne) without handes, which ſmote the Image vpon his feete that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces. Then was the iron, the clay, the braſſe, the ſiluer, and the gold, broken al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, and became like the chaffe of the ſommer flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the wynde caried them away that no place was found for them, and the ſtone that ſmote the Image, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a great mountayne, and filled the whole earth.</hi> This ſtone is Chriſt, to whom is giuen all power, as wel in heauen as in earth, that he may rule with power in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery place. And Daniel ſaith agayne in the <hi>7.</hi> chapiter, (where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foure Monarchies are vnderſtood by foure beaſts) that Chriſt ſhould come and beare rule in the tyme of the fourth Monarchy, that is, when the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes ſhould rule. Let vs now gather by the ſeuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wekes in the <hi>9.</hi> chapter, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the tyme ſhould come, and how long they had to looke for Meſſias, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſhould begin to rule.</p>
                  <p>By this reuelation of Daniel, the Iewes are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and mightely conuinced, that Chriſt according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophets foretelling, is alredy come on thouſand and fiue hundred yeres ago. For firſt, the angel ſayth in the <hi>9.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 9.24.</note> chapter (out of which I recited the wordes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie before) that there were ſeuenty wekes determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and appointed for the people of the Iewes, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy city Ieruſalem, after which <hi>70.</hi> wekes, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and prieſthood of the Iewes ſhould ceaſe. And the whole ſtate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould be deſtroyed. For after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time appointed, God determined that al Ieruſalem ſhold be ouerthrown, &amp; that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes ſhold be partly blinded, and partly deſtroyed.<note place="margin">The weeks of yeres.</note> We muſt alſo vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that the angel ſpeaketh not here of ſuch wekes as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth on ſeuen dayes. For ſo ſeuenty wekes woulde ſcarce make two yere. But he ſpeaketh of ſuch wekes, as ſeuen yeare do make but one weke, and ſo ſeuentie wekes do make foure hundreth and ninety yeres. For ſo the ſcripture ſpeaketh in other places. And the ſame phraſe and maner of ſpeaking, is vſed in Leuiticus.<note place="margin">Luk. 25.8</note> And ſo alſo al men indued with the ſpirit of propheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng haue hitherto continually vnderſtood it.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:16253:79"/>Note diligently by the wordes of the prophet, how great things ſhould happen in the dayes of Meſſias, &amp; how wonderful the power of his kingdom ſhould be. Theſe are the wordes of the prophet.<note place="margin">Dan. 9.24.</note> 
                     <hi>To finiſh the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, and to ſeale vp the ſinnes, and to reconcile the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and to bring in euerlaſting righteouſnes, and to ſeale vp the viſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and propheſie.</hi> There had bene Moſes, and many other doctors of the law, who had taught &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded them to do thinges honeſt, &amp; godly, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> things that were euill and wicked: but none of them all did any thing preuaile. For ſinne once reuei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the law,<note place="margin">The wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes of our nature without grace.</note> became greater and more ſinfull. For nature without grace, though ſhe be neuer ſo much admoniſhed, or inſtructed vnto honeſty and godlines, &amp; though ſhe be neuer ſo much moued, &amp; pricked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vnto pietie and obedience towards God, will yet for all that play her wonted prankes, and run her old race, followyng her fanſie, &amp; goyng on as ſhe was wont. Nay thenceforth after ſuch admonition, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth worſe and worſe, more vnhappy, wicked, &amp; more inflamed by heat of luſt to offend. So then ſinne remayned and could not be taken away, but as Paule witneſſeth to the Galathians, our offences afterward became greater, heauier, and more, &amp; more without ceaſing.<note place="margin">How need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full it was that Chriſt ſhould com Acts. 13 38.</note> And therfore was it nedefull that Meſſias him ſelfe ſhould come and mend this matter, &amp; bring helpe with him: otherwiſe, our caſe had bene worſe &amp; worſe, and we had fallen into greater and greater euils.

                  <p>Marke diligently the words of the Angell Gabryel, he ſayth thus:<note place="margin">Dan. 9.25.</note> 
                     <hi>from the going forth of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould be builded again. That is, from that time that they were commaunded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payr, and reſtore Ieruſalem. The Angel himſelf doth plainly expound it, and he beginneth at that yeare, wherein it was decreed, that Ieruſalem ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored. Now muſt we ſearch the raignes, and the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions of kings and kingdomes out of Hiſtoriogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and out of them, the number of yeres wil plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare. We will therfore take theſe <hi>70.</hi> yeares, to begin at the ſecond yeare of king Darius, which was called Long-hand. For that yere the Lord ſpake by the Prophets Haggeus, and Zacharyas, and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that Zerobabel ſhould builde the Temple: as we read in the firſt chapter of both the prophets.</p>
                  <p>The ſame commaundement alſo,<note place="margin">1.

And the account doth well, and iuſtly agree, if we begin our computation there. For from that time, in which that
<pb facs="tcp:16253:80"/>
propheſy was vttered by Haggeus, vnto the baptiſme of Chriſt, when he tooke vpon him his miniſtery, and began the regyment of his kingdome, or new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (for this Angel here deſcribeth him to be a king, whoſe youth, and childhood being paſt, and now alre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy come to mannes ſtate, might, as a king, take into his own hands the rule of his kingdome,) from that tyme, I ſay, vnto Chriſts baptiſme, were almoſt <hi>483.</hi> yeares. Out of which yeares, we may make <hi>69.</hi> of theſe yearly weekes, and euery one of them ſhall contayne <hi>7.</hi> yeares, of which Gabryel here ſpeaketh, ſaying: <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til our Lord Chriſt come</hi> there are ſeuen weekes, and <hi>62.</hi> weekes, that is, <hi>69.</hi> weekes. Thus therfore, muſt we recken.

                  <p>In ſuch kind of reckning, euery day, and houre cannot be ſo exactly numbred. It cannot be, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in ſuch computations, there wil be ſome od dayes, more, or les. For, it happeneth oftentimes in hiſtories, that halfe a yeare is taken for a wholl yeare.

                  <p>Some men count theſe <hi>70.</hi> weekes, from the <hi>20,</hi> and laſt yeare of Cambiſes, father vnto Daryus, who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Nehemias to come to Ieruſalem to reedefy the Citie.<note place="margin">Nehe. 2.6.</note> And, there was two yeares between the <hi>20.</hi> of Cambyſes, and the <hi>2.</hi> of Darius. For, when any great, or worthy thing is done in three yeares, or is a good long time in doing, we vſe often to containe, and ſet it forth, as done in one of the three yeares, or at one time, ſaying, ſuch a thing was done this, or that time. And
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:16253:80"/>
ſo muſt we ſay here. God commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, the ſecond yere of Daryus, that Ieruſalem ſhould be reedefyed: that is, at, or about thoſe times, when <hi>Nehemias</hi> was ſent back by Cambiſes, and began to reedefy Ieruſalem. For, it was a worthy work, nay, a wonderfull worthy work, and many there were which began it: yea, the Angels them ſelues vrged, and furthered the work. But they did not all begin it at one time, and houre.<note place="margin">Zach. 1.12.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Angel Gabryell deuided theſe <hi>70.</hi> weekes into three parts, in euery one of which three, was ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table thing done. In the firſt ſeuen weekes (ſaith Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryel) that is, in <hi>49,</hi> yeares <hi>the walles, and ſtreetes of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem ſhalbe builded, but in a troubleſome time.</hi> For, the Samaritans, Saneballat, Tobias, and others there abouts ſtayd, and hindered the building all they could. Wherupon, the Iewes were put to great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and care, and brought in great danger, and diſtres. You know how the Iewes ſaid vnto Chriſt in Iohn: <hi>Forty ſixe yeares was this temple a building,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iohn. 2.20.</note> 
                     <hi>and wilt thou reare it vp in three dayes?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then Danyel ſaith, after <hi>62.</hi> weekes ſhall Meſſias, or Chriſt, ſuffer death. Plainly geuing vs to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what ſhould happen when theſe <hi>69.</hi> weekes were ended, and when Chriſt had begun his raign: to wit, a great, and wonderful thing ſhal then chaunce. Chriſt ſhall then be crucifyed: as it came to pas in deed, in the <hi>4.</hi> yeare after the <hi>69.</hi> weekes, and after he began to preach. Wherfore, Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal at laſt come to naught, and be waſted, and vtterly deſtroyed, and the people of the Iewes ſhalbe cut of.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things were all fulfilled <hi>40.</hi> yeares after the aſcention of Chriſt, when Titus the Romane Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, Sonne to Veſpaſyan, after long beſeeging Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, at the laſt ouercame it, and miſerably deſtroyed it. As Chriſt had told them before with bitter teares, weeping for the miſerable, and horrible calamity, and ouerthrow, which he ſaw hang ouer the Citie, becauſe ſhe knew not the time of her viſitation. For,<note place="margin">Luk. 19.42</note> Chriſt ſayth in Luke: <hi>the dayes ſhal come vpon thee, that thine enemies ſhal caſt a trench about thee, and compas thee round, and keep thee in on euery ſide, and ſhall make thee

euen with the ground, and thy children which are in thee, and they ſhall not leaue in thee a ſtone vpon a ſtone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou kneweſt not the time of thy viſitation.</hi> And, Titus did this ſame which Chriſt foretold: as we read in Ioſephus, which ſaw all the doyngs with his eyes. For Titus beſeeged the Citie ſo that no Iew could eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape. The circuit of the wall was thirty, and nine fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs: and when he had entrenched them, he handeled them ſo miſerably, that with hunger they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned to eat beaſts dung dryed, girdles, ſhoes, and ſkincouerings of ſhields: yea, they ſought their foode in Iakeſes: And one woman roſted, and eate her own child for extreem hunger. Many alſo in that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie flew, and butchered one another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</note>Beſides this, the plague alſo was ſo whot amongſt them, that lodgings, houſes, and all the ſtreetes, were filled with dead bodyes. To be ſhort, this vnthankfull City taſted ſo much of Gods wrath, for their forſaking of Chriſt our Sauyour, that we haue no example like it. Thoſe that dyed, and thoſe that were murthered in the Citie, in that war, were ten hundreth thouſand: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide ſeuenty thouſand more, which were ſent bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaues into Egipt, there to moyle all their liues in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable toyle like beaſtes. They which were vnder ſixteen yeares old, were ſold more cheape then dogs: and as Egeſippus witneſſeth, thirtye Iewes were ſold for a peny. Titus burned the Temple, and ſacked the City, and layd it euen with the ground.</p>
                  <p>Thus were the Iewes driuen out of their country, and ſcattered abroad in the world, in which (as vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds) they haue wandred vp and down theſe <hi>1576.</hi> yeares, hardened in hart, and ſtroken with blindnes, a moſt miſerable people, hauing neither kingdome, nor prieſthood.

Chriſoſtome ſaith in his ſecond oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt the Iewes, that they went about to reedefy the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to doe ſacrifice as before.

But the Iewes abhorred that Enſigne of the Romaines, who they called prophane Gentils, and they very opprobriouſly, called it an abhomination. Now, abhomination is ſuch a thing as we deteſt, and abhorre as a dead, putrified, and foul ſtinking carrion.</p>

                  <p>This propheſy, in deed, proueth that the Iewes are marueilouſly blinded, and indurated. For, they might by this propheſy haue learned the tyme of Chriſt his firſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming. The Angel here plainly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that Meſſias ſhould come between the captiuity of Babylon, and the laſt deſtruction of Ieruſalem. For, he reckneth plainly, how long Ieruſalem, and the tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple, ſhould from that time forth contynue, and ſtand: And he ſayth, that <hi>490. yeares were determyned,</hi> and he telleth vs in expres words, that then, almoſt in the end of thoſe yeares, after <hi>62.</hi> weekes, to wit, in the middeſt of that yearly weeke Meſſias ſhould come in his own perſon, and be cut of, and killed, and that the Sacrifice ſhould then ceaſe, and deſolation come, and abide for euer vpon them.</p>
                  <p>Now, the Iewes plainly know, that the captiuity of Babylon was to be ended before two thouſand yeares were paſt: and they alſo know, that both the Temple, and the Citie of Ieruſalem was waſted, and deſtroyed by Titus the Romane Emperor, and that they could neuer ſince yet be reſtored, and repayred. They muſt therfore, confes, wil they, nil they, (ſeeing that theſe <hi>70.</hi> weekes are fully paſt, and ſeeing they may with their eyes vew, and behold the deſolation, and deſtruction of their City, which now hath conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued aboue fifteen hundred yeares, ſacked, and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,) that Meſſias is already come. Neither can they alledge any thing (y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath any face of truth) of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man that was killed, or ſlayn, in that laſt yearely weeke, but only of Ieſus of Nazareth, the true Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, our only Lord, and God.

it was a very trifling toy, and far more fenceles, and fooliſh then an old wiues tale.

Verely (to ſpeake a truth) though he be counted a great doctor with the Iewes, I found nothing at all in him. In deed, I ſaw there in him, what a horryble plague it is, when God ſtriketh his enemies with blindnes. And, who ſo euer are ſo blinded, are in a moſt darck night, and thick, and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cloud.

                  <p>Thoſe ſeuenty weekes may alſo be numbred, and gathered by the time of the high Prieſts regiment in Ieruſalem, vnto the preaching of Chriſt, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. And we muſt begin (if we account thus) at the firſt yeare of the high Prieſt Iehoſcua, when he was diſiniſt of Aſſuerus, and came out of captiuity into the land of Iuda. For, Gabryell ſaith in the propheſye of Danyel: that after Danyell began to pray, the word went out when he prayed for the people in the firſt yeare of Daryus long hand. And, from the firſt yeare of Darius long hand (vnder whom Iehoſcua the high Prieſt bare office <hi>20.</hi> yeares) to the time of the Apoſtles (after the reſurrection of Chriſt, when ſinne ſhould haue an end, and when iniquity ſhould be blotted out) are found by computation <hi>70.</hi> yearely weekes, that is, <hi>490.</hi> yeares. And thus I gather mine account.</p>
                  <p>Iehoſcua the high Prieſt, after his returne out of captiuity, was high Prieſt <hi>20.</hi> yeares. His ſonne Ioa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chim was Prieſt <hi>48.</hi> yeares. Eliaſib <hi>21.</hi> Ioiadad <hi>24.</hi> Ioathan <hi>24.</hi> Iaddua <hi>10.</hi> Onias Priſcus <hi>27.</hi> Symon Priſcus <hi>13.</hi> Eliazarus <hi>20.</hi> Manaſſes <hi>27.</hi> Symo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iuſtus <hi>28.</hi> &amp; Onias <hi>39.</hi> yeres. And after him came Iudas Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabeus, and ruled <hi>5.</hi> yeares. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ionathas his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>19.</hi> Symon <hi>8.</hi> Iohn Hircan <hi>26.</hi> Ariſtobulus <hi>1.</hi> Iohn Alexander <hi>27.</hi> Alexandra his wife <hi>9.</hi> &amp; Hircane y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt <hi>34.</hi> yeares. And after him raigned Herod by the commaundement, &amp; auctority of the Senate of Rome, This man thruſte him ſelfe into the Iewiſhe king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, quite againſt the Iewes will, and he ruled <hi>37.</hi> yeares. And in the <hi>30.</hi> yeare of the raign of this Herod,<note place="margin">Chriſt liued <hi>33.</hi> yeares, &amp; a half here vpon earth.</note> was Chriſt our Sauyour borne, who lyued in this earth <hi>33.</hi> yeares, and a half. Now gather theſe yeares together, and add to them <hi>3.</hi> or <hi>4.</hi> yeares moe in which the Apoſtles preached the goſpel of Ieſus Chriſt, after they had receaued the holy Ghoſt on whitſonday, and then ſhall you finde theſe <hi>70.</hi> yearely weekes, to wit,
<pb facs="tcp:16253:84"/>
thoſe <hi>490.</hi> yeares: Of which Daniel ſpeaketh in his <hi>9.</hi> chapter.

There you heard that Chriſt is not onely a true man, but alſo very God, and that the deuine and humaine nature in Chriſt are vnited in vnity of perſon. Of the which vnitie of perſon, the godly man Athanaſius in his Creede, which he drew out of the holy ſcripture, writeth very godly, and well: And as he confeſſeth in his Creede, ſo with him the whole Catholike church doth now thinke, and beleue.</p>

                  <p>Theſe be Athanaſius wordes of the ſonne in his godhead,<note place="margin">Chriſt is God.</note> according to his deuine nature &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. There is one perſon (ſaith he) of the father, an other of the ſonne, and another of the holy ghoſt: but the godhead of the father, of the ſonne, and of the holy ghoſt is all one, the glory equall, the maieſty coeternal. The father vncreate, the ſonne vncreate, and the holy ghoſt vncreate. The father incomprehenſible, the ſonne incomprehenſible, and the holy ghoſt incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<pb facs="tcp:16253:85"/>
The father eternall, the ſonne eternall, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghoſt eternall, yet they are not three eternals, but one eternall. As alſo there be not three incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, nor three vncreated, but one vncreated, and one incomprehenſible. So likewiſe the father is almighty, the ſonne almighty, and the holy ghoſt almighty: and yet they are not three almighties, but one almighty. So the father is God, the ſonne is God, and the holy ghoſt is God: and yet are they not three Gods, but one God. So likewiſe the father is lord, the ſonne is lord, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoſt is lord: and yet not three lordes, but one lord. For like as we be compelled by chriſtian veritie to acknowledge euery perſon by himſelfe to be God and Lord: ſo are we forbidden by the Catholike religion, to ſay there be three gods, or three lordes. The father is made of none, neither created, nor begotten. The ſonne is of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father alone, not made, nor created, but begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The holy ghoſt is of the father, and of the ſonne, neither made, nor created, nor begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding. So there is one father, not three fathers: one ſonne, not three ſonnes: one holy ghoſt, not three holy ghoſts. And in this trinity none is afore, or after other: none is greater nor leſſe then other. But the three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: be coeternal together, and coequal. So that in all thinges (as is aforeſaid) the vnitie in Trinitie, and the Trinitie in vnitie is to be worſhipped. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that will be ſaued, muſt thus thinke of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Furthermore, it is neceſſary to euerlaſting ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he alſo beleue rightly in the incarnation of our lord Ieſus Chriſt. For the right faith is, that we beleue and confeſſe, that our lord Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of God, is God and man. God of the ſubſtaunce of the father begotten before all worlds, and man of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce of his mother borne in the world, perfect God and perfect man, of a reaſonable ſoule, &amp; humaine fleſh ſubſiſting. Equall to the father as touching his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and inferior to his father as touching his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Who although he be God and man, yet he is not two, but one Chriſt. One not by conuerſion of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head into fleſh, but by taking of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> manhood vnto God. One altogether not by confuſion of ſubſtance, but by
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:16253:85"/>
vnitie of perſon. For as the reaſonable ſoule and fleſhe is one man: ſo God and man is one Chriſt. You muſt thus vnderſtand this. Theſe two natures, God and man in their owne ſubſtaunce do not periſh, decay, or chaunge: but both of them continue whole and perfect in Chriſt, which is but one perſon and not two. So you heare that Chriſt the naturall ſonne of God is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes continuing in the father, with the father, and begotten from euerlaſting of the father, whoſe eternall generation can neither be comprehended with reaſon, nor expreſſed with wordes, but is incomprehenſible, and cannot with mans tonge be vttered, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Eſay ſaith: <hi>Who ſhal declare his age?</hi>

                  <p>But I need not bring many proofes and teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies for the confirming of the euerlaſting natiuitie of Chriſt. For where ſo euer the Scripture intreateth of Chriſtes true Godhead, there doth it alſo firmely, and without queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proue his natiuitie to haue bene with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beginning. For if he be God, and yet not the father (as the ſcriptures do plainly,<note place="margin">Chriſtes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie.</note> notablely, and diſtinctly make difference of the perſons by their properties in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:16253:86"/>
Diety, then is he another perſon, and not God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and yet no new, nor ſtrange God. For, ſeeing that there is but one eternall God, it cannot be ſayd, that God the Sonne is yonger then God the Father, as naturally it is amongſt creatures, that the begetter ſhould bee before the thing begotten. God cannot be comprehended in time, but is euerlaſting, and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: and therfore the ſonne in eternity, muſt be like the father. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be ſayd, there was a time in which the ſonne lyued not, and was afterward made. It may be thus ſaid of creatures, but not of the eternall word, which was before all beginning, and was with God, and the ſame word was God,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1.3.</note> and <hi>all things were made by it.</hi> Therfore, Chriſt is the only begotten ſonne of God, as God begotten before all time, the naturall ſonne of God, becauſe he hath the ſame nature, which the father hath, who begot him, as Hilary ſaith. We may make ſimilies, not agreeing in deed in euery point to ſo great a miſtery, yet ſuch, as wherby we may, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſort, vnderſtand theſe great myſteries as far forth as mans mynde can conceiue of them.

<pb facs="tcp:16253:87"/>
of the father, where Moyſes ſayth: <hi>God created, God ſpake.</hi> And afterward we may alſo ſee the perſon of the ſonne. For he is not onely God, but he ſpeaketh the word, which worde was with God in the beginnyng, and is the ſecond perſon in the godhead. And ſeing that God by that <hi>ſpeaking</hi> or <hi>worde,</hi> created all thinges: it followeth neceſſarily, that the worde which he ſpoke was before all creatures, &amp; that it was alſo God. And the word could not be a creature, ſeeing God by the word in the beginning made, and created all things. In aſmuch then, as the word was not a creature, and ſeeing it was with God the father before all time, and al creatures, when as yet there was no creature made, it followeth of neceſſity, that the word is eternall, and true God. For what thing ſo euer is neither creature, nor contayned in time, nor hath beginning, that muſt needes be true God: ſeeing that between God the creator, and the creature there is no mean: but what ſo euer hath any beeing, is ether vncreated, or created, either y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> creator, or creature: If therfore, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word which God ſpake be no creature (for by the word al creatures were made, &amp; ſo the word was the maker of all things made) it followeth that this <hi>word</hi> muſt needes be true, and eternall God.<note place="margin">Ioh. 1.14.</note> And this <hi>word</hi> is the ſonne of God, which in tyme became man as Iohn ſayth: <hi>The worde was made fleſh,</hi> that is, true and naturall man.

                     <hi>In the beginning was the worde, and the worde was with God, and that worde was God. The ſame was in the beginning with God, all thinges were made by it, and without it was made nothing that was made.</hi> This teſtimony proueth euidently and ſtrongly, that Chriſt is true, and natural God: for that word is very Chriſt which in tyme was made fleſh.</p>

                  <p>But let vs interprete and expound theſe wordes, <hi>In the beginning,</hi> that is, when the creatures which before were nothing, tooke their beginning to be ſomething. For before that beginning of the creatures, there was no beginning.

Note diligently, that Iohn ſaith well and plainly, <hi>The worde was with God.</hi> For he doth there plainely and diſtinctly ſeperate the perſon of the word, or of God the ſonne, from the perſon of God the father. If any thing was with god before the beginning of creatures,<note place="margin">Chriſt the ſecond per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</note> then was he not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. But what I pray you was with God? the worde was with God, but ſomething to be with God, is not God to be alone. Therfore of neceſſitie muſt that word be another perſon, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that God is, with whom it was in the beginning.</p>
                  <p>It followeth: <hi>And God was the worde.</hi> You know that God ſayth thus in Deut. <hi>Heare O Iſrael,</hi>

                     <hi>the Lorde our God is Lord onely, or is one God.</hi> If therefore he be one God, it followeth, that God himſelfe is eſſential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that ſame word which was in the beginning before all creatures: wherby you ſee that this word in eſſence, is God himſelfe, or that God himſelf is the word.

There are alſo many teſtimonies by which the godhed of Chriſt is plainly declared, although this name God be not alwais expreſly ſet down. For the circumſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, do mightily proue that euen he, of whom the ſcripture in that place ſpeaketh, is true God, as God ſaith in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay.<note place="margin">Eſa. 43.11</note> 
                     <hi>I, euen I am the Lord, and beſide me there is no ſauior.</hi> Here God himſelfe ſaith, that there is none other <hi>Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiam,</hi> deliuerer, or ſauiour, but only he. And this name <hi>Sauiour,</hi> both in the old &amp; new teſtament, is alwais at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed only vnto Chriſt.

For when we write or ſpeak of the prince of any country or prouince, then it is all one whether we ſay here ſtandeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right lord, heyre, &amp; gouernour of this country, or here ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth he to whom this land or prouince belongeth, or to whom this region is ſubiect by the commaundement of God.

hope, and inuocation. For we beleue in him, loue hym, feare him, put our whole truſt in him, &amp; call vpon him, and ſuch like. This is the honor due to God only. But the ſonne muſt be honored after the ſame maner, and therefore he is very God. Many ſuch reaſons may be gathered, as we read in <hi>Hilary, Ambroſe,</hi> &amp; <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> but ſpecially in <hi>Cyril.</hi> in thoſe <hi>14.</hi> famous bokes which he intituled, <hi>the treaſure againſt the Arrians.</hi>

                  <p>There is alſo a teſtimony of Chriſtes godhed,<note place="margin">Eſa. 11.10.</note> in the <hi>11.</hi> of Eſay, where the Hebrue text is thus. <hi>The nations ſhal ſeeke vnto it,</hi> or ſhall make inquiſition after it, that is, Chriſt. The <hi>70.</hi> interpreters haue thus tranſlated it, the Gentils ſhal truſt in him (y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, in Chriſt.) He ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth here of the root <hi>Iſai</hi> or <hi>Ieſſe</hi> (that is, Chriſt) which thing muſt nedes be confeſſed, becauſe none can deny it. If then the Gentils muſt put their truſt in him: and yet muſt we truſt in none but the true God, becauſe none but he can, or wil ſaue vs, it followeth by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent, that Chriſt is very God. The Euangeliſt S. Iohn is ful of ſuch arguments, wherby the godhead of Chriſt may be proued by his diuine workes.<note place="margin">Ioh. 5.21.</note> 
                     <hi>Like as the father raiſeth vp the dead and quickeneth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo the ſonne quickeneth whom he wil.</hi> Wherby it is playne, that the ſonne is God. For to raiſe vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dead to life, is a worke of an infinite power, which none can do vnleſſe he be true God. But ſeing that Chriſt raiſeth vp the dead to life, by his own power, as wel as the father, it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is true God. It is alſo ſaid in Iohn:<note place="margin">Ioh. 5.19.</note> 
                     <hi>What ſo euer thing the father doth, the ſame doth the ſonne alſo.</hi> Wherby is proued that the father &amp; the ſonne, are both of one eſſence, nature, and power. Therefore the ſonne is true God, and doth as wel create as the father. And in the ſame chap. <hi>As the father hath life in himſelf, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hath he giuen to the ſonne to haue life in himſelf.</hi> We creatures haue life, but not of our ſelues. For it is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs of God by grace. But the heauenly father hath life in himſelf, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he himſelf is eſſentially life it ſelfe, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath he taken it of another, neither gaue he life ſo vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne, as he geueth it vnto creatures, as thogh he had not had it before, or as though he had ben with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, and afterward receiued it of his father as other creatures do, nay, there was no ſuch giuing. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſon
<pb facs="tcp:16253:96"/>
in his godhed hath not his life after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſort, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father begot him from euerlaſting of his own ſubſtance &amp; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. And thus the father borowed his ſubſtaunce of none. And whatſoeuer the ſonne is, or hath, the ſame he is, &amp; hath of the father. The father who is very lyfe in himſelfe, begot the ſonne, who alſo in like maner is very life in himſelf, as ſ. Auguſt. ſaith: And Chriſt is the very ſonne of God,<note place="margin">Iohn. 11.25</note> therefore true God. And ſo ſaith Chriſt in Ioh. <hi>I am the reſurrection and the life.</hi> Wherby it foloweth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt is true God. For he is life in deed, and maketh the dead to liue: which thing is not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> work of a creature, but only of God. And Chriſt ſayth in the x. of Iohn:<note place="margin">Iohn. 10.18</note> 
                     <hi>I haue power to lay downe my life, and haue power to take it againe.</hi> Which thing he did on Eaſter day, when by his owne proper power and might, he roſe from the dead. This is the worke of God, and he attributeth and taketh it to himſelf. For he ſaith: <hi>I haue power, &amp;c.</hi> We alſo ſhall riſe againe, but we haue no power to rayſe vp our ſelues, as Chriſt raiſeth himſelf: but he through his owne proper ſtrength and vertue, doth rayſe vs vp.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt alſo is omnipotent, but none but God is om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, therfore Chriſt is God. Paul proueth his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power to the Phil. where he ſayth: <hi>Chriſt ſhall chaunge our vile body,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 3.21.</note> 
                     <hi>that it may be faſhioned lyke vnto his glorious body, according to the working: wherby he is able euen to ſubdue all thinges to himſelfe.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zach. 12 10.</note> Therefore muſt he nedes be almighty, &amp; ſo of neceſſity true God. God ſaith in Zachary: <hi>I wil poure vpon the houſe of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, and vpon the inhabitantes of Ieruſalem the ſpirite of grace, and of compaſſion, and they ſhal loke vpon me who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue perced.</hi>

                  <p>Here God ſpeaketh. For to giue the holy ghoſt, is the very office of God. And the ſame onely Lord God ſaith: He was nailed on the croſſe, and pierced through the ſide.

                  <p>The Godhead or deuinitie of Chriſt is euery foote in the new Teſtament proued and confirmed out of the ground of the olde Teſtament. Paule in the Actes ſayth: <hi>Take heede therefore vnto your ſelues,</hi>

for which ſaying, the Iewes being about to ſtone him, ſayde: <hi>Thou being a man, makeſt thy ſelf a God.</hi> Here the Iewes plainly vnderſtood, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when Chriſt called God, his father: and when he ſaid, I, &amp; the father are one, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> then he called himſelf true God, and the naturall ſonne of God, who is like to his father, as ſ.

                  <p>That is, a child moſt highly to be praiſed, &amp; yet neuer as he deſerueth, is this day borne of an vnſpotted vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> comfort of vs miſerable men: where as if this child had not bene borne for vs, we had all vtterly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, for he was borne for the helpe, helth, and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of vs all. Wherefore moſt ſwete Ieſu Chriſt our child moſt comfortable, (which for our ſakes humbled thy ſelfe, &amp; vouchſafed to be made man) we beſeech thee to deliuer and defend vs from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tiranny of the deuill.</p>

For vnles this child had bene borne for vs, we had abidden ſtill in our ſinnes, neither could we haue deliuered our ſelues, but had all died eternally. Thirdly, the church confeſſeth, that this ſauior or ſaluation happened to all: which thing Sime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on confeſſeth in Luke,<note place="margin">Luke. 2.30.</note> ſaying: <hi>Mine eyes haue ſeene thy ſaluation, which thou haſt prepared before the face of all people:</hi>

By which ſong the church confeſſeth, this childe to be

And where as he had ſayd, that who ſo beleued in him, ſhould not ſee death for euer: yet he himſelf both ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red death, and was buryed in the ſepulcher.</p>
                  <p>Here if we were led by humayne reaſon, we ſhould with Cleophas and his companion ſay: Wee hoped that he had bene the redemer of Iſraell, whiche ſhould haue ſaued vs all, but now he himſelf is dead?

December, in the midſt of Winter, and was ſwadled &amp; layd in a manger. For Ioſeph and Mary could not be lodged in any Inne, for there was no roume for them.

What hurt then I pray you can ſin do vs? ſeing it is purged, &amp; wiped away. That ſatiſfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his is ours, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue in Chriſt, &amp; acknowledge him for our prieſt, &amp; ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for ſin. What hath death to do w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vs? &amp; how can it hurt vs? this prieſt hath by his ſacrifice broken &amp; bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to pouder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cruel &amp; horrible ſting of death. Beſides all this, Chriſt is our eternal king, who in all dangers can deliuer vs. Both theſe two offices, to wit, of prieſt and king belong duely to him, the true and firſt begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſon of god the father, and the bleſſed virgin Mary.</p>
                  <p>We alſo by faith in him are made prieſts (as Pet. wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by faith we may be bold to go to the father, &amp; as children aſke thoſe things of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.

So Paule maketh his prayer through Chriſt, as our high prieſt, by whom, &amp; for whom, only we, &amp; our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are acceptable vnto God y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father. As it is ſaid to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hebr.<note place="margin">Hebr. 13.75</note> By Ieſus Chriſt we offer <hi>the ſacrifice of prayſe alwais to God,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, <hi>the fruit of the lips which confeſſe his name.</hi> Furthermore, it is worthy marking, that where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophets do promiſe to the people of God deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce from ſin, death, &amp; al other euils, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there Ieſus Chriſt is promiſed. For we ſee this is the purpoſe of God, that he wil not helpe any, deliuer any, nor be gracious to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but only for Ieſus Chriſtes ſake. As Peter ſayth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Acts.<note place="margin">Acts. 4.12.</note> We haue ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in none but in Ieſus Chriſt: <hi>For among men there is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> none other name vnder hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, wherby we muſt be ſaued.</hi> Now looke on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.<note place="margin">Chriſt our ſauiour.</note> For both the name &amp; worke of Chriſt is liuely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in it.

                     <hi>What is man that thou art (ſo) myndful of him? and the ſonne of man that thou viſiteſt him? for thou haſt made him little lower the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, &amp; crowned him with glory &amp; worſhip, thou haſt made him to haue dominion in the works of thine hands: Thou haſt put al things vnder his feet: all ſheep &amp; oxen, yea, and the beaſts of the field, the foules of the aire, &amp; the fiſh of the ſea, and that which paſſeth thorough the pathes of the ſeas. O lord our lord, how excellent is thy name in all the world?</hi> This pſalme (which the new teſtament doth ſoundly ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto vs) propheſieth of Meſſias, ſaying: that it ſhould come to paſſe, that for a tyme Chriſt ſhould be humbled, deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and as it were forſaken of God the father. And that tyme was the ſpace of <hi>3.</hi> dayes, when he was taken &amp; deliuered to the Iewes and Gentils, and when they beat him w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whips, crouned him w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thornes, crucified him, killed him, and buried him. The Hebrues text is thus: <hi>Vathechaſrehu meat meeloim,</hi> that is, for a tyme thou ſufferedſt him to be without God, or thou ſhalt ſuffer him a while to be forſaken of God. For it ſeemed that God had forſaken him all the tyme of his paſſion, euen vnto the third day, becauſe he ſuffred him to be ſlaine, and buried. And the Iewes thought that Chriſt had bene dead in deede, and vtterly deſtroyed. Neither did they vnderſtand that comfortable decree of the Lord, how that therefore he ſent his ſonne that he might by his croſſe reconcile his father to vs, and that Chriſt ſuffred not of conſtraynt, but was willingly and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obedient vnto his father, euen vnto the death, the death of the croſſe.

of angels, how the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould the ſcriptures be fulfilled, which ſaye it muſt be ſo?</hi> Chriſt would here ſtand great neede of help, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> therby he might ſuccor vs. For, for our ſakes he came into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> erth &amp; humbled himſelf: and ſuffred him<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelf to be forſaken, &amp; to wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t al help, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no angel could help,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.8.</note> or deliuer him. Paul vnto the Hebr. expoundeth theſe words of the Pſal. &amp; applieth them vnto Chriſt, ſaying: <hi>For in that he hath put al things in ſubiection vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him: hee left nothing that ſhould not be ſubiect vnto him: but yet we ſee not all thinges ſubdued vnto him, but we ſe Ieſus crouned with glory &amp; honor, which was made a little inferior to the angels through the ſuffring of death, that by gods grace he might taſt death for al men: for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him, for who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are al things, &amp; by whom are al things, ſeyng he brought many children vnto glory, that he ſhold conſecrate the prince of our ſaluation through afflictions, for he which ſanctifieth, &amp; they which are ſanctified are al of one.</hi> And ſo the prophet marueleth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this true man, &amp; ſonne of man was for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> little time of his preaching and paſſion here vpon earth forſaken, conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned, humbled, or abaſed: but after a little, that is, after <hi>3.</hi> dayes highly glorified, honored, crouned, &amp; made lord of al creatures in heauen &amp; earth: And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> afterward his name became renomned, famous, and admirable, through the whole world. As Paul out of this Pſal. teacheth at large to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Epheſ. where he ſayth:<note place="margin">Eph. 1.17.</note> 
                     <hi>That the god of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt the father of glory might giue vnto you the ſpirit of wiſdom &amp; reuelation, through the knowledge of him, that the eies of your vnderſtanding may bee lightened, that ye may know what the hope is of gods calling, &amp; what the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of his glorious inheritance is in his ſaintes, &amp; what is the exceding greatnes of his power towards vs, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Chriſt, when he raiſed him vp fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dead, &amp; ſet him at hys right hand in the heauenly places, far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue al principalitie &amp; power, &amp; might, &amp; dominion, and euery name that is named not in this world only, but alſo in that that is to come: &amp; hath made al thinges ſubiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet, &amp; hath appointed him ouer all thinges, to be the head to the church which is hys body, euen the fulnes of him that filleth al in al things.</hi> Many myſteries of our faith are contained in this Pſalm, to wit, Chriſtes paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,

reſurrection, and dominion which he hath ouer al creatures, both in heauen, &amp; earth, and what the fruite of Chriſtes workes, to wit, of his paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is. For he was by his paſſion to deſerue, and giue vs infinite benefits, that all which beleue the goſpel might be deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Satans kingdom, &amp; haue place w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and be ruled, and ſaued by Chriſt for euer.

                  <p>The fruit and commoditie of this moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous death and glorious reſurrection of Chriſt, is the redemption of mankind from al euils, and calamities,
<pb facs="tcp:16253:114"/>
and mans victory ouer death, the deuil, &amp; damnation. So that now by Chriſtes infinite and great merites, &amp; by his deſerts, and not by ours, we obtayne forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our ſinnes grace, peace w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God, perfect holines, the holy ghoſt with his giftes, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> bleſſed adoption, by which we are the children of god, and he our father: and that after this ſhort life we looke for the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our fleſh, in which we ſhall receiue both in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoule and immortal, &amp; incorruptible inheritance: an inheritance that ſhal not fade, euen life euerlaſtyng, and the eternall kingdom of Chriſt which was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vs in the law and prophets. But al this we receiue onely in Ieſus Chriſt the ſeede of Abraham and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, according to the fleſh, who purchaſed and deſerued all theſe things for vs. This is daily preached to vs in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpel, and all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are called vnto this grace, none is excluded, none refuſed.</p>
                  <p>The Euangeliſts and Apoſtles, as the true expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Prophets, do worthely in all places of the new teſtament, preach and declare out of the prophets this fruit of Chriſtes paſſion. Paul to the Rom. ſayth: <hi>Chriſt was deliuered to death for our ſinnes,</hi>

                     <hi>God ſetteth out his loue toward vs: ſeing, that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for vs. Much more then being now iuſtified by his bloud, we ſhall bee ſaued from wrath thorough him. For if, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we were his enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his ſonne, much more being reconciled, we ſhalbe ſaued by his life.</hi> And to the Cor. he ſayth:<note place="margin">1.

                     <hi>Chriſt is made of God vnto vs, wiſdom, and righteouſnes, and ſanctification, and redemption.</hi> In theſe few wordes, he openeth and declareth all thoſe things which Moſes and the prophets wrote before of the offerings, ſacrifices &amp; oblations which were offred for the peoples ſinnes, and offences. Theſe ſacrifices &amp; oblations could reconcile none vnto GOD, neyther clenſe any man from ſinne, but were onely figures of that moſt precious ſacrifice the bloud of Chriſt.

Therfore Peter with great boldnes inſtructing the Iewes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt,<note place="margin">Act. 4.10.</note> comprehendeth all the whole matter briefly in few wordes, in the <hi>4.</hi> chap. of the Acts, where he ſayth: <hi>You haue crucified Chriſt, whom God rayſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dead. This is the ſtone which was caſt aſide of you buil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ders, which is become the head of the corner, neither is there ſaluation in any other.

If in this life onely we haue hope in Chriſt, we are of all men the moſt miſerable. But now is Chriſt riſen from the dead, and was made the firſt fruits of them that ſlept.

                  <p>Seyng then that Chriſt by his death ſatiſfied for our ſinnes, and ſuffered death for them, that he might put them away: it is not to be doubted, but that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo aboliſhed and deſtroyed death, which had rule &amp; do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion ouer vs. But if he deſtroyed death in vs (as I ſay he did,) it followeth well, that we ſhall riſe agayne to lyfe.

Paul in that cha. reaſoneth thus. Chriſt is riſen from the dead, therefore ſhal we alſo riſe againe from the dead, becauſe he dyed and roſe againe only for our ſakes, &amp; for our ſaluation. If we ſhould ſtil abide in death, then the death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt had nothing profited vs, neyther had they wrought any alteration in our nature: but we had ſtill bene (&amp; ſhould ſo haue continued) in death euen as in our earthly father Adam we were borne to die. But god forbid it were ſo, our hope is ſure. For as it is certaine that Chriſt roſe from death, &amp; ſitteth at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right hand of God, ſo certain is it y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ſhal riſe again, becauſe Chriſt is our head, our bridegrome, our redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer &amp; our life.

For we haue often ſeene how theſe wicked ſprites lay wait for vs, and ſeke by al meanes to enda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, vndo, and deſtroy vs. But God hath ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated all their aſſaults. And now I pray you recite &amp; expound the propheſies of the myſtery of our fayth, to wit, of the death, reſurrection, and kingdome of Chriſt, which we haue now in hand.</p>

                  <p>I wil firſt begin to recite the teſtimonies of the Pſalmes, as I haue done before. For of al the prophets Dauid is the floure: for he propheſieth much, plainly &amp; euidently of Chriſt, (who ſhould be born of his familie or tribe, according to his humanity)<note place="margin">Chriſtes kingdome.</note> &amp; of all his workes &amp; myſteries. You haue heard before how y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kingdom of Chriſt was deſcribed in the <hi>2.</hi> Pſal. where God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did not onely conſtitute his ſonne king ouer the Iewes: but alſo gaue him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gentils of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole world for his inheritance. Wherupon it followeth that Chriſt ſhould not abide in death, although he died as true ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſeed of Dauid. For it was requiſite y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> accordyng to the decree and ſtatute of God the father, he ſhould be king ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole world. Which thing could not haue bene in any corporall &amp; worldly maner, as the Iewes dreamed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Meſſias ſhould rule &amp; haue in this world a great &amp; corporall kingdom. And therfore it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that the ſtate and condicion of Chriſtes kingdome ſhould be altogether of another ſort then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kingdomes
<pb facs="tcp:16253:120"/>
of this brickle &amp; frail life are. Chriſts kingdom was to be euerlaſting, &amp; he which is in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhal for euer haue euerlaſting righteouſnes, peace, ſafety, life, felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp; eternal ſaluation. And therfore he endeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pſal. w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, (concluſiue exclamation) <hi>Bleſſed are all they which truſt in the lord.</hi> But he ſpeaketh not of a te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral bleſſing here in this world. For the king himſelf, and his chief nobles, his welbeloued prophets, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles had no great plenty here of worldly welth, and pleaſure of this life, but were miſerably afflicted, and always ſubiect to many grieuous perils &amp; calamities. In the <hi>3.</hi> Pſal. Dauid ſaith, I take my reſt and ſleepe, &amp; I riſe agayne, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lord ſuſtaineth me. The old church a thouſand yeres ago, vnderſtood this propheſie of the true death and reſurrection of Chriſt, as appeareth by <hi>Arnobius.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 14.7.</note> And againe Dauid ſaith: <hi>O giue ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto Iſrael out of Sion when the lord turneth the captiuitie of his people, then Iacob ſhal reioyce, and Iſrael ſhalbe glad.</hi> Here Dauid in ſprite deſireth, and godly, and feruently prayeth Meſſias, who onely is called in the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the true ſauiour and redeemer, ſeeing both the Iewes and Gentiles by him are deliuered from all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils and perils, that they may through him, and in him enioy euerlaſting bleſſednes.</p>
                  <p>S. Auguſtine alſo taketh theſe wordes to bee ment of Chriſt. And take this (wife) for an infallible rule for you in the ſcripture, that in ſo much as there is but one onely deliuerer giuen of God vnto men, by whom they may be iuſtified and ſaued, that Chriſt is truely, properly, &amp; certainly ment, ſignified, and vnderſtood in all thoſe and ſuch places, where there is mention made eyther of ſaluation, ſauiour, redeemer, or deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, whether it be ſpoken in figures, or playne and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt wordes. For ſeyng Iſrael and Iacob, that is, the catholike church beyng congregated of the Iewes &amp; Gentils, ſhould be glad &amp; reioyce in Chriſt, they muſt liue in peace and ſecurity. That cannot be, vnles ſuch troubles be taken away, &amp; the conſcience be comforted, &amp; death aboliſhed. Theſe words therfore importe, and plainly ſhew, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our redemer out of Sion (or as it is in <hi>Thargum,</hi> our redemption &amp; ſaluation which is Chriſt himſelf) ſhal take away &amp; deſtroy all thoſe things that

For of neceſſity he muſt lead captiuity, captiue, that is, he muſt ouercome Satan, who hath vs in captiuity, and he muſt deliuer vs from his tiranny. Chriſt in the Pſalmes ſayth: My fleſh alſo doth reſt in hope: <hi>For thou wilt not leaue my ſoule in hel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 16.10</note>

                  <p>And Peter and Paul haue expounded this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to be ment of Chriſt, ſaying:<note place="margin">Act. 2.31.</note> that he ſhould dye and be buried, but not corrupt and rotte, as our ſinfull fleſh doth: and that his bleſſed &amp; deuine ſoule ſhould not be caſt in hell or graue, but be vnited againe to the body, &amp; that he ſhould riſe agayne from death, &amp; ſit at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right hand of God, &amp; giue vs euerlaſting lyfe. It was meet, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould be the firſt fruites of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which were dead, that by his glorious reſurrection, he might open vs the true gate vnto lyfe, and make the way for vs,<note place="margin">1.

Wherfore it is no wonder though Cleophas and his companion vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it not.</p>
                  <p>Dauid ſaith: <hi>O lord my God I cryed vnto thee,</hi>

The <hi>22.</hi> pſalm doth more fully and plainly then any other, deſcribe the paſſion, reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and euerlaſting kingdom of Chriſt. And there are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame wordes in which Chriſt in his great agony, &amp; his extreme neceſſitie, called vnto his father vpon the croſſe. And that pſalm deſcribeth Chriſt his paſſion, &amp; alſo ſetteth forth the fruite of his death &amp; reſurrection, ſaying:<note place="margin">Pſal. 22.1</note> 
                     <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me. All they which ſee me, haue me in deriſion, they make a mo, &amp; nod their hed, ſaying: He truſted in the lord, let him deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer him, let him ſaue him, ſeyng he loueth him.

                  </p>
                  <p>Behold, how exactly, how liuely, how truly, and how excellently the holy ghoſt foretold Chriſtes paſſion, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the very ſame wordes which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes vſed, when they mocked Chriſt hanging on the croſſe.

Here haue ye the kingdome of Chriſt, which is the holy catholike church ſpread ouer the face of the whole earth. And now in all things and places, where that euill ſpirit the deuill before ruled by lying, (hauing ſeduced all people, and led them into all kindes of errors and idolatry,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.</note> that they might be (as Paul ſayth) without Chriſt, without the worde, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope, and without God in the world) there I ſay, in thoſe partes ſhall Chriſt now be heard.</p>

But if Chriſt ſhal haue ſeede, that is to ſay, ſpirituall children borne by the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, as well of the Iewes as Gentiles (as you ſee by this text, he muſt) then can he not be ouercome by deth, nor abide in the graue. For how could he then regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and congregate the Gentiles together into the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
<pb facs="tcp:16253:122"/>
fayth, and rule ſuch an empire which ſhould fill the whole world, whoſe dominion ſhould not extende through one piece of the earth onely, but thorough the whole circuit of the wide world, and ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue for euer world without end? For whoſoeuer beleueth in Chriſt ſhalbe partaker of euerlaſting lyfe. Whereſoeuer ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the prophets ſet down the kingdom of Chriſt, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it ſhall haue continual peace, health, and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citye, there is ſet downe, and in dede declared, the deth and reſurrection of Chriſt, and all chriſtian men. For if Chriſt ſhalbe a king, and ſet vp and haue an heauenly and euerlaſting kingdome, it muſt needes follow, that he ſhould leaue this temporall &amp; mortall lyfe by death, and aſcend into that euerlaſting and glorious kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of heauen, and ſo could not be kept in death. He muſt alſo of neceſſity haue ſome people ouer who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he myght be Lord and king, and whom he might rule &amp; gouern. Wherefore his people alſo can not abide in death, but muſt with their eternall king liue for euer.

                  <p>Agayne in the <hi>69.</hi> pſalme, the prophet doth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and manifeſtly ſpeake of Chriſtes paſſion, &amp; the fruit therof,<note place="margin">Pſal. 69.4.</note> ſaying thus in the perſon of Chriſt: <hi>They haue hated me without a cauſe. I reſtored that which I toke not. The rebukes of them that rebuked thee, are fallen vpon me. They gaue me gall in my meate, and in my thirſt they gaue me vineger to drinke.</hi>

                  <p>You heare it alſo in this place foretold, how the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors ſhould crucifie and handle him, and how they ſhould giue him gall and vineger to haſten his death, or rather to increaſe his payne and tormentes. Which

And in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame pſalm, hard after, Chriſt requireth of his heauenly father, that he might riſe agayne, and aſcend into heauen, and that after his reſurrection, he might be exalted vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right hand of his father, ſaying:<note place="margin">Pſal. 41.10</note>

                  <p>And in the <hi>40.</hi> Pſalme, Dauid propheſieth of the deſtroying, and abrogating of the Iewes ſacrifice, and he ſpeaketh of the true ſacrifice of Chriſt: by which he reconciled God vnto vs, and fulfilled all his fathers will, and ſatiſfied the law.

                     <hi>Sacrifices and burnt offrings thou didſt not deſire: (for thou haſt prepared myne eares) burnt offerings, and ſinne offrings haſt thou not required.

                  </p>
                  <p>And afterward he prayeth his father, that he would not forſake hym in his croſſe &amp; affliction, ſaying: <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw not thou thy tender mercy from me (O Lord) let thy mercy and thy truth alway preſerue me: for innumerable troubles haue compaſſed me.</hi>

                  <p>And this verily is a wonderfull and vnſpeakeable kind of mercy and goodnes. Theſe are his words: <hi>My ſinnes haue taken ſuch hold me, that I am not able to loke vp, yea, they are more in number, then the heares of my head. Therefore my harte hath fayled me.

                  <p>Now then, if Chriſt hath ſwallowed vp death, then are we ſurely deliuered from it.

                  <p>Both the Iewes and chriſtians vnderſtande this chapter of the tyme of Meſſias, when the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment through the whole world is preached.

in mens hartes, when they heare the goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt. And this is the meaning of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophet. Though the rebellious and diſobedient Sinagog, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Iuda, and the greateſt part of the Iewes, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their kingdome be aboliſhed and deſtroyed: yet ſhall ſome remayne and continue ſtill, &amp; the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the lord ſhall floriſh, and be encreaſed. This was fulfilled in the land of Iuda, euen in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes tyme, when he liued here on this earth. For Chriſt and his diſciples went and coaſted thorough ouer all that country. Chriſt was in the deſert, and the Goſpell was preached in the cities, ſtreetes, villages, fieldes, waters, and mountains, with great, and ſtrange won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. And although theſe things were done in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſkor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt and fruitful, in as much as welſprings of Gods grace ſtreamed, and flowed therin with great aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance: and in as much as the holy ghoſt by the goſpell cauſed notable and pleaſaunt fruit to grow where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had bene, through the ſlender knowledge of God, great drought, thirſt, and barennes.</p>
                  <p>But be not theſe (I pray you) to wit, faith in Chriſt, knowledge of our ſinnes, and graces of God, remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinnes, with a pacified and quiet conſcience in the lord, and good workes comming of true charity and vnfayned fayth, excellent faire fruites, and beautifull and fragrant flowers?

he willingly ſuffered death for vs. For if he had not offered himſelfe freely vnto the handes and crueltie of the Iewes, they could neuer haue touched hym or hurt him a haire. But he tarieth not in death, becauſe he is God, who promiſed alſo vnto vs miſerable ſinners, power, helpe, comfort, conſolation, and euerlaſtyng ioye. And whatſoeuer he hath promiſed, he both can and will performe. And in that he is God, he roſe by his owne power from the dead, and tooke all power from death.

And Chriſt alone, and no other, could, and was to ſatiſfy God for them. Our works, ſuffrings, and merits, were neuer able to haue done it. Our righteouſnes, therfore, or ſaluation, lyeth not in our hands, nor in our works, or ſufferings: but in the actions, and paſſions of Chriſt Ieſus our Lord. It is he that purgeth, pardoneth, and wypeth away our ſinnes, not for the worthynes of our deſertes, but euen for his own ſake.<note place="margin">Good workes are not to be truſted in.</note>

                  <p>Here we haue the cauſe, and fruit of Chriſtes paſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; therefore theſe two diſciples ſhould haue thought thus: He hath ſuffered, and yet not by conſtraint, but of his own free will.

And a little after, Eſay in his <hi>4 4.</hi> chapter, ſheweth what fruites came of theſe tribulations, vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, and afflictions, which Chriſt ſuffered for our ſinnes: verely, euen this, that we haue the holy ghoſt, with all his giftes geuen vs, by which the church, the kingdome of Chriſt, doth grow, and floriſh, as a field that is well watered, and moyſtned with fruitful ſhow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ers,<note place="margin">The rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, and faithfull are true Iaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites.</note> in the moneth of May.

And hereupon groweth, and commeth true
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:16253:144"/>
Iacob, and Iſrael. Thus therfore, ſaith he vnto Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el: <hi>I wil poure water vpon the thirſty, and flouds vpon the dry ground. I will poure my ſpirite vpon thy ſeed,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eſay. 44.3.</note> 
                     <hi>and my bleſſing vpon thy buds, and they ſhal grow as among the gras, and as the willowes by the riuers of waters. One ſhal ſay, I am the Lords, another ſhall be called by the name of Iacob, and another ſhall ſubſcribe with his hand vnto the Lord, and name him ſelfe by the name of Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here you haue the calling of the Gentiles: ſo that euen they alſo ſhalbe Iacob, and Iſrael in ſpirite, and faith: and they ſhall both in word, and deede, profeſſe Chriſt to be their Lord, and God. This therfore, is the true deliuerance of Iſraell, that Chriſt doth delyuer both the Iewes, and Gentiles from their ſinnes, from al errors, and from euerlaſting death: and geueth them his holy ſpirite, that they may acknowledge, confeſſe, prayſe, and glorifie God: and at the laſt riſe again from death, and liue for euer. This is the ſacred ſeed of Abra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ham, of which the kingdome of Chriſt groweth to gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and greter ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>The diſciples, perchaunce, were of this opinion, that Meſſias ſhould delyuer the Iewes by force of armes, and edge of ſword, and enrich them in the land of Canaan with continuall peace, plenty, and aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all kind of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities. But this was a light, and miſerable kind of deliuerance, in comparyſon of our deliuerance, from that eternal captiuity, and tiran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Sathan, with which we all were oppreſſed. And when the prophet hath now reproued, and accuſed Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell for their Idolatry, becauſe they honoured not the true God aright, He ſayth thus:<note place="margin">Eſa. 44 12.</note> 
                     <hi>Reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber theſe things O Iacob, and Iſrael, for thou art my ſeruant. I haue formed thee, thou art my ſeruant, O Iſraell, forget me not.

of mankind, but Ieſus Chriſt: neither is there any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God, which can purge, and pardon ſin, but Chriſt alone. Euery creature may wel, and worthely reioyce, and prayſe God, for this glorious, incomparable, and ineſtimable deliuerance.</p>
                  <p>This benefit, to wit, that our only, and eternal prieſt Chriſt Ieſus, the king of Iſraell, hath blotted out our ſinne, deſtroyed hel, ouercome death, and reconciled vs to God: is ſo great, glorious, incomparable, and ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable a benefite, that it paſſeth all benefites that could happen to vs: nay, there is none any whit like it.</p>
                  <p>Eſay propheſyeth again in the <hi>49.</hi> chapter plainly, and manifeſtly of Chriſt, ſaying: <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, the redeemer of Iſraell,</hi>

                     <hi>As I liue, ſaith the Lord, thou ſhalt ſurely put them all vpon thee as a garment, and gird thy ſelfe with them like a bride: For thy deſolation, and thy waſt places, and thy land deſtroyed, ſhall ſurely be more narrow for them that ſhall dwell in it. And they that did deuour thee, ſhall be far away. The children of thy Barons ſhall ſay againe in thine eares: The place is ſtraite for me, geue place to me, that I may dwell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then ſhalt thou ſay in thine hart: who hath begotten me theſe, ſeeing I am barrain, and deſolate, a captiue, and a wanderer to, and fro? and who hath nouriſhed them? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I was left alone. Whence are theſe? Thus ſaith the Lord God. Behold, I will lift vp my hands to the Gentils, and ſet vp my ſtandard to the people, and they ſhall bring thy ſonnes in their armes, and thy daughters ſhall be cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon their ſhoulders. And kings ſhall be thy nurſing fathers, and Queenes ſhall be thy nurſes. They ſhall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip thee with their faces towards the earth, and lick vp the duſt of thy feet. And thou ſhalt know that I am the Lord, for they ſhall not be aſhamed that wayt for me. Shall the pray be taken from the mighty? Or the iuſt captiuity deliuered? But thus ſaith the Lord. Euen the captiuity of the mighty ſhall be taken away, and the pray of the tirant ſhall be delyuered. For I will contend with him, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth with thee: and I will ſaue thy children, and will feed them that ſpoyl thee, with their own fleſh: and they ſhalbe dronken with their own bloud, as with ſweet wine.

And therfore ariſe, and come out, and fly ſpeedely out of ſathans kingdome: repent, &amp; amend your ſelues, and beleeue the goſpel: and then ſhal your harts be lighted with knowledge, then ſhall you both learn to know your ſelues,<note place="margin">The word, the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the holy Ghoſt, the welſprings by which our thirſt is quenſhed</note> &amp; you ſhall alſo receiue true holynes, &amp; be ſaued. In the kingdome, and dungeon of ſatha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is nothing els but euerlaſting hunger, &amp; penury of al things: but in the church, which is the kingdome of Chriſt, are moſt delectable, &amp; pleaſant paſtures. For the goſpel is a moſt ioyful meſſenger, and comfortable word of life, which floweth with al delites, comforts, &amp; ioyes: in which we finde, and haue plenty, and ful ſtore of al pleaſure, &amp; goodnes: to wit, forgeuenes of ſinnes, true holynes, peace with God, ioy of ſpirite, and peace of conſcience, and life: yea true, and perfect conſolation. And this is the meaning of theſe ſtrange words of the prophet, where he ſaith. <hi>They ſhal feed in the wayes, and their paſtures ſhalbe in the plaines,</hi> or <hi>in al the tops of hils, they ſhal neither be hungry, nor thirſty, and the heat of the day ſhal not touch them.</hi> But whence haue they ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and pleaſures? The prophet anſwereth, becauſe their deliuerer wil rule, &amp; gouern the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They are (as you here) in the kingdome of mercy, Chriſt conducteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by his word, &amp; ſpirit. Theſe three: to wit, the word, the ſacraments, and the holy ſpirit, are the welſprings, and flouds, by which only this ſpirituall thirſt, may in all places, and for euer be quenched. And leaſt this ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all thirſt ſhold not be quenched: or theſe paſtures of life be hid, and not eaſely found, the Lord wil make all the <hi>mountaines</hi> (into) a way: that is, there ſhalbe in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, or companies of Chriſtians place, that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eaſely, &amp; with no troble, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may come vnto him. There ſhalbe a very broad, &amp; frequented way, redy, and eaſy to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:16253:147"/>
be found, ſo that no man ſhall haue need to aſke which is the way, leſt therby the free acces to Chriſt, might be hindered. For in what kind, and ſtate of life ſo euer any man ſhalbe, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it be not quite co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to gods word, if he beleeue in Chriſt, doubtles he ſhall both haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuenes of ſinnes, and be inheritor of euerlaſting life, whether he be Iew, or Gentil, maſter, or ſeruant, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtres, or mayd, maieſtrate, or ſubiect: and <hi>they ſhal come from far.</hi> Before, the people of god was in the litle land of Chanaan: and the church of God was ſtraitly laced, &amp; he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>med in: but now it ſhalbe let loſe through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wholl world: and as Chriſt ſaith in Luke, they ſhal <hi>come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Eaſt, and from the Weſt, and from the North,</hi>

                     <hi>and from the South, and ſhall ſit in the kingdome of God.</hi> Then the prophet biddeth all creatures <hi>reioyce, and be glad,</hi> for al creatures which are, are in two places: to wit, in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; earth: now the occaſion &amp; cauſe why they ought to triumph, and reioyce, is this. Firſt, becauſe God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath ſent his ſonne into this earth, &amp; geuen vs his goſpel from heauen, which is a meſſuage of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt God, &amp; man: and the word of grace, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes. Secondly, becauſe that now the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, faithful chriſtians are out of al danger, and in a happy eaſe: for death is ſubdued.<note place="margin">The godly are terrified with Gods iudgement, and fere hel.</note> But he calleth the good chriſtians <hi>poore,</hi> or afflicted: becauſe, while they liue in this earth, they are heauy, &amp; troubled inwardly with feare, &amp; terror of death, and gods iudgement: and outwardly they are ſhaken with perſecutions, and all kinds of calamities. But this is our conſolation, that god calleth vs his people: for if we be his people, &amp; he our comforter, &amp; protector: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may we in deed reioyce. For if God be with vs, who can be againſt vs? what hurt can the creature doe vs? how ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it diſmay vs, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the creator himſelf doth comfort, &amp; help vs, the fleſh is very weak, and when the tempeſt,<note place="margin">Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected doubt ſometime that God hath forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them &amp; will diſtroy them.</note> &amp; thick miſtes of aduerſitie, and tribulations come vpon vs: when we are ouerwhelmed with vehement croſſes: &amp; when we are ſomething ſharply aſſaulted with ſorowes, feares, and temptations: then doe theſe comfortable promiſes of gods grace and help, vaniſh away, and fly out of our ſight, in ſo much, that we think God hath forſaken vs,
<pb facs="tcp:16253:148"/>
and that he is angry, and ſo plagueth vs, becauſe he intendeth to deſtroy vs. For thus ſaith Sion, to wit, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miſerable afflicted godly in their infirmities, and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous temtations: <hi>The Lord hath forſaken me, the Lord hath forgotten me,</hi> my ſinnes O Lord, are haynous, great, &amp; greeuous, and to heauy for me to beare.

                  <p>Our weake &amp; fearfull fleſh cannot alwayes expel ſuch feares, &amp; cogitations. For though the promi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes of God be neuer ſo plentiful, &amp; manifold, &amp; though god euery foot help vs, yea, and that ſo manifeſtly, and redely, that we may euen grope, and feel him: yet whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> troble, and greef come again, we are ſo vnmindful of al the former helps which we haue had, and we are ſo tro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bled, &amp; ſoroful, as if the lord could forget, or forſake vs, which in deed he can neuer doe. For he hath promiſed both to help, &amp; comfort vs, and ſurely he will performe his promiſe, for he is true, &amp; therfore he wil doe it, he is of ſuch might, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whatſoeuer he ſaith he can perform it. Wherfore Eſay addeth to this complaint of the godly which mourn vnder the cros, a moſt ioyfull, &amp; comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table conſolation, by which we may help this our da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtardly weaknes,<note place="margin">A comfort for vs in our tempta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions.</note> and deſperation, and comfort our he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy harts thus wraſtling vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cros, &amp; preſſed down with aduerſitie, &amp; deſperatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And to doe it the liuelier he boroweth a ſimilitude of nature, which is commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly knowen amongſt all men, to wit, the louing, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly affection of women, which of all other, are moſt naturall to their children. We know y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God hath plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the mother ſuch fauour towarde the fruite of her womb, that ſhe wil rather dye, then ſuffer her children to take wrong or iniury. But if any mother could ſo forget her ſelfe, as not to be touched with the feeling of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:16253:148"/>
her childrens harmes: yet ought al chriſtians to beleue that god neither wil, nor can forget his loue, and mercy towards vs. His faith, &amp; loue ſurpaſſeth the loue of all creatures, as Chriſt himſelf ſufficiently ſheweth in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, by the example of the father, which geueth not a ſtone to his ſonne in ſtead of bread which he required.<note place="margin">Math. 7.9</note> If we therfore, which are euil, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> geue our childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good things, &amp; dayly protect them, and that with al care, and diligence? how much more carefully, firmely, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, ſhal god loue vs, and faithfully defend vs his poore children? This is a notable, and worthy ſaying, but only here apprehended by faith, otherwiſe we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it not.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, the prophet declareth how the lord lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his church, where he ſaith, that <hi>he hath grauen it on the palme of his hand,</hi> or, <hi>he holdeth it in his hand.</hi> By which he geueth vs to vnderſtand, that he diligently ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reth, &amp; prouideth for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church:<note place="margin">God wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth ouer vs to ſaue vs.</note> that he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no more forget it, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forget y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which I haue alwayes before mine eyes, and in my hand. And ſeeing the Lord alwaies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth the walles of this ſpirituall citie, to wit, vs, &amp; that vpon purpoſe to preſerue vs, care for vs, watch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs, and look to vs: ſurely none can ſo aſſault vs, or beſiege vs, &amp; our city, but the lord wil ſee it, &amp; although for a time he ſuffer vs to be tempted, or afflicted, yet wil he not ſee vs ouerwhelmed, or deuoured.</p>
                  <p>This city hath alſo ſkilfull builders, or carpentars, to wit, ſincere, &amp; godly teachers, which daily enlarge, and fortefy it. And though tirants, &amp; hereticks aſſail it, and goe about to ouerthrow it, yet haue they no ſucces in their doings, but by their attempt reape perpetuall ſhame: for it is builded vpon a ſure, and ſtrong rock, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which the gates of hel ſhal not preuail. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in the words following, ſaith: that a great, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of people ſhall come together out of all places, and ſhal beleeue the goſpel, &amp; be gathered into the church. God alſo ſwereth by his holines, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, euen of thoſe which in the beginning ſtode againſt the church, ſhal afterward come into it, and be ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments to it, that it may glory in them: which came to pas in Paul, &amp; many others. And it ſhalbe daily more,
<pb facs="tcp:16253:149"/>
and more inlarged by the great multitude of people, which dayly run thus vnto it. At the beginning, it was but litle, and had but a ſmall company, and was like a barrayn woman, which is ſolitary in her houſe: but theſe faithfull chriſtians, whereof the number was at the firſt ſo ſmall, ſhall wonder to ſee themſelues made ſo great a multitude, and to be ſo increaſed. And they ſhall maruaile whence ſuch a great people can come. Vnto this the holy Ghoſt maketh anſwere, and ſaith: <hi>I will bring them, behold, I wil open,</hi> or lift vp my hand, <hi>and I will hold vp the ſigne,</hi> that is, the cros of Chriſt, whereunto I will make thy diſparſed children aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that ſhalbe done by a ſingular, and notable way of mildnes, and lenity.</p>
                  <p>For, the Goſpell is a ſweete, gentle, faire, and fatherlye kinde of ſpeech, which draweth ſuch as be children, by moſt comfortable, and ſweet promyſes of help, and comfort.</p>
                  <p>And by this Goſpel, the moſt mighty potentates, and puiſſaunt kinges of this world, are drawen, and allured into the Church, that they may beleue the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and be a helpe, and protection vnto the Church. Yea, they ſhall reuerence, honour, and highly eſteeme the church, for they <hi>ſhall worſhip it with their faces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the earth.</hi> That is, they ſhal fal proſtrate before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church. This is the promiſe of the lord, &amp; it muſt nedes be fulfilled: though oftentimes in the eyes of the world it ſeemed impoſſible to be brought to pas, and cleane contrarye to reaſon. But wee muſt expect the Lords leaſure,<note place="margin">He that ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience ſhall not fayie of helpe.</note> and liue in hope. For the Lord will performe what ſo euer he hath promiſed. Which when he ſhall doe, then are we deliuered, and moſt happy. For, whoſoeuer beleeueth in the Lord, and paciently watcheth for his helpe, and beleeueth his word, ſhall not be confounded, but haue, and ſee his hope fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>But now if the church in her weakenes, and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity ſay: O god, how ſhall this be that thou ſayeſt, I ſhall haue ſo many children, which ſhall come vnto the Goſpell, ſeeing they are ſo ſubiect vnto cruell ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, that they cannot get from them, and come vnto me. For ſinne is a cruell tirant, and by it they are ſore
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:16253:149"/>
blinded: yea, death, and hell alſo keepeth them cloſe priſoners: and by good right, for their harts are har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened. which thing theſe words folowing import,<note place="margin">Sin a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ouer vs</note> where the Prophet ſaith: <hi>Shall the pray be taken from the mighty?</hi> to which God maketh anſwere, ſaying: the church ſhall be great, ample, and famous: and thoſe which are now in bondage, ſhall haue their freedome, whether thoſe tirantes will or not: for God will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy thoſe tirants: and will bring forth his people, and deliuer the church: and the very tirants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, ſhall be their own deſtruction. And where he ſayth, <hi>Shall that which is in bondage by the iuſt man be brought to freedome?</hi> this is the meaning. The law, ſinne,<note place="margin">2.

                  <p>But there is a ſtronger Lord, whoſe name is Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, he by good right hath made vs free, and that by his moſt pretious, &amp; ineſtimable <gap reason="foreign">

I hid not my face fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhame, and ſpitting, for the Lord god wil help me, therfore ſhal I not be confounded: therefore haue I ſet my face like a flint, and I know that I ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi> Theſe two diſciples thought y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt had bin cleane confounded, and extinguiſhed: but the thyrd day they ſaw it hapned far otherwiſe, to wit, Chriſtes enemies were ſubdued, and Chriſt himſelf exalted.<note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Church by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham and</note>

                  <p>And Eſay in his <hi>51.</hi> chapter doth comfort the church congregated of the Iewes, and Gentils. The church in this world hath affliction, and tribulation, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he comforteth it with the example of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and Sara. Abraham, and Sara were, by reaſon of their old age, paſt all hope of children, neither could it be thought that of them ſhould come ſuch a famous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<pb facs="tcp:16253:150"/>
Notwithſtanding it came ſo to pas, that this ſeed was ſo multiplyed, that it was like the ſand of the ſea, according to the promiſe of the Lord. And ſo though the litle flock of Gods people in this world, be as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate, barrain, and only widow, in compariſon of the great number of the vngodly, yet ſhall it come to pas that thou ſhalt increaſe, grow, and be exceeding fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous. For, although thou haſt in this world many enemies, which do all they can, and imploy themſelues totally to ſubuert thee, to root thee out, and to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw thee, yet can they not hurt thee.</p>
                  <p>Their councels, and deuiſes ſhall all be fruſtrate: yea, they them ſelues, how great ſoeuer they be, are nothing: nay, much les then nothing. For the moth ſhall eat them as a garment, and the worme ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume them like a veſture: but my righteouſnes remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and abideth for euer, from generation, to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Yea, and he addeth a ſaying that is ful of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. <hi>The Lord ſhal comfort Syon, he ſhall comfort all her deſolations,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eſay. 51.3.</note> 
                     <hi>and he ſhall make her deſert like Eden, and her wildernes like the garden of the Lord. Ioy, and gladnes ſhall be found therin: praiſe, and the voyce of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging.</hi> Which is to ſay, although the church be like vnto Abraham, ſolitary, and forſaken: yet ſhall ſhe be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſed, and floriſh like as a moſt pleaſaunt garden. And therfore we ought in no wiſe to be offended at the baſe eſtate of Chriſt, and his former comming: or at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtate of the church, while ſhe walketh in this croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked world like to a pilgrim.</p>
                  <p>And a litle after in the ſame chap. the Lord ſpeaketh to his people:<note place="margin">A great comfort.</note> 
                     <hi>I, euen I am he that comforteth you.</hi> This is a greate, and worthy miſtery, for we vnderſtand here Chriſtes humanitye, as if he ſhould ſay: my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants the prophets haue much, and diuerſly hetherto comforted you, but yet came not that true comfort of Iſraell. Now therfore, will I far otherwiſe comfort you, and that much more liuely, and in greater aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance then before. For now, euen I my ſelfe will come in mine own perſon, and comfort Sion. This came to pas when Chriſt was made man, and liued among men. For he ſent not a Prophet, or an Angel, but he himſelf at the fulnes of time, came in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleſh, that
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:16253:150"/>
he might comfort vs in the fleſh. Thoſe two diſcyples plainly felt that comfort on Eaſter day, when God him ſelfe in mans nature glorifyed, and reuiued them, and cheered vp their heuy harts by the ſcriptures. And E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay ſaith further: <hi>Ariſe, put on thy ſtrength, O Syon, &amp;c.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eſay. 52.1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here again doth the prophet comfort gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, making them promiſe of Chriſt their redeemer, as if he ſhould ſay, goe to Sion, thou which art ſo often afflicted, and troubled, thou which art now priſoner vnto thy enemies, and now again ſet free, and yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward captiue, and laid waſt, ſo that thou maiſt true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be called moſt miſerable, and wretched.</p>
                  <p>Now reioyce. Now be glad, and leap for ioy, for thy miſeries ſhal once haue end. For I promiſe thee a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and more bleſſed ſtate in time to come. Hetherto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thou haſt bene for a time redeemed from thy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and for a tyme thou hadſt tranquility, and waſt afterward afflicted agayn: But now thou ſhalt enioy at laſt ſound conſolation, which ſhall neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, after which, no captiuity, or deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal follow. Wherfore put all heauines from thy hart, be of good courage, and awake, for the time wil once come wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou ſhalt truly be ſet at fredome. And thus the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaketh of that euerlaſting deliueraunce which we haue in Chriſt, who hath vanquiſhed our enemies by whom we were afflicted, and vexed in captiuity: and hath deliuered vs from them, and reſtored vs to our old fredome: and all this he did of his own mere grace, cleane without our deſert, though it coſt him euen the beſt, chiefeſt, and moſt precious humain thing he had. For he offered vp his body for a ſacrifice, and ſhed his moſt precious bloud for our redemption, that thereby he might put away our ſinnes, ouercome death, and vanquiſh, and deſtroy hel. And by theſe works of his euerlaſting, and infinite perſon, he obtayned for vs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting <hi>redemption</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sion the ſpirituall citie is vexed, and troubled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is conſtrayned to harborow, and beare the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly. It can in no wiſe paciently ſuffer ſuch griefe, and blaſphemies againſt god, and his name. Therfore God by the prophet promiſeth that the vncircumciſed, and vnclean, that is, the vnbeleuers, whoſe hartes in
<pb facs="tcp:16253:151"/>
Chriſt Ieſus are not purified, nor cleanſed, but hate the church of God,<note place="margin">None me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuers.</note> ſhall not haue their habitation there. But this thing in this world is done ſpiritually.

But at the day of redemption, when Chriſt ſhal come to geue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, then at the laſt ſhall all the wicked infidels, and falſe Chriſtians, be euen corporally ſeperated from the faythfull.

                     <pb facs="tcp:16253:155"/>For though it may ſeeme abſurde, and fooliſh vnto reaſon, that Chriſt ſhould promiſe to deliuer other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from death, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he himſelfe dyed: and to bring all that beleeue, into eternall glorye, when he himſelfe came to eternall ſhame, and ignominye, yet this was the beſt, and faſteſt way, to worke ſuch a notable worke. For how can the euerlaſting wiſedome of the Father doe anye thing, that ſhould not in euery reſpect be moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently done.

                  <p>They thinke it wickedly, and impiouſly ſpoken, to ſay, that ſo great a king of Iſraell ſhould hang among theues, as though he himſelfe had bene a moſt hainous and wicked offender. But if ſo be that the ſight of him ſhould be ſo miſerable, ſo vncomely, ſo vile, &amp; ſo foule, that he ſhould not ſeeme in the eyes of the world, to be
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:16253:155"/>
the man that could deliuer others, and bring them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to honor, and glory, (and this is the cauſe that he is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtone of offence,) how could his kingdome be world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Worldly princes muſt ſo ſet forth their brauerye, dignitye, and maieſtye, that men may euen be amaſed to looke on them. A worldly kingdome cannot ſtand, vnleſſe there be in it both power, and reuerence: where the prince is poore, and diſpiſed, and oppreſſed by the violence, or tyrannye of the enimies, and doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in power nor riches excell his aduerſaryes, there muſt needes the kingdome come to ruine.</p>
                  <p>But this our king wil doe more by his humility, then all the princes, and kings in this earth can doe with all their pompe, power, and riches. What will he then doe? The prophet ſaith: <hi>He wil ſprinkle many nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> This is an Hebrue phraſe. This word <hi>Iaſeh,</hi> doth properly ſignify to diſparce abroad hether, and thether, euen as drops of water are ſprinkled here, and there.<note place="margin">What the ſprinkling of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils is.</note> This ſprinkling therfore of the Gentils, betokeneth nothing els in this place, but to teach, and preach gods word amongſt them, and this was fulfilled when the Apoſtles, by the holy ghoſt inſtructed the gentils, through the holy word, &amp; opened vnto them this wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of Gods grace in chriſt Ieſus, and diſperſed the ſame, euen as the fertil rayn which falleth in May, that therby the fruit of Gods knowledge might grow, and increaſe in al places: &amp; they preuailed ſo much, through the preaching of Gods word, that euen mighty Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and Princes did worſhip, adore, and feare Chriſt Ieſus, and held their tongues, and were aſtonyed. And among the gentils, and other places, where before the ſcriptures were not known, and the goſpell not heard of, there did they ſo teach the great miſteries of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that they were vnderſtood.</p>
                  <p>Seeing then in Chriſt ſuch great maruels, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are wrought, to wit, that God becommeth man, humbleth him ſelf very lowly, and in his bleſſed, and moſt innocent humanity (I cal his humanity, that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main nature which he tooke vpon him) ſuffereth ſo great ſhame, greef, and calamity, and that of his own people, whom he had bleſſed with ſo great, and infinite
<pb facs="tcp:16253:156"/>
benefits both of body, and ſoule: and ſeeing he muſt by this his ignominious death be exalted vnto honor, and ſo begin his ſpirituall kingdome, but muſt firſt as the king therof, labour vnder his croſſe, and ſuffer all kind of calamity, and ſhame, and yet by the ſelf ſame croſſe, be in deed exalted to honor, and crowned with eternall glory: ſeeing, I ſay, theſe wonderful things, which are contrary to mans reaſon, are done in Chriſt, and his kingdome, the world wil not beleeue them, when it ſhal heare them. And this thing the prophet ſaw in ſpirite, when he ſayd: <hi>who wil beleue our ſaying?</hi> that is, our preching, or doctrine. They are ſo great, &amp; incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible,<note place="margin">The ſtrange wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king of god</note> that reaſon cannot be perſwaded, that ſuch won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders either are, or could be done.</p>
                  <p>How did the Iewes, I pray you, in the beginning receaue the goſpel? how abſurd, and incredible ſeemed it to them? Did not Chriſts own kindred (according to the fleſh) at the firſt, refuſe to beleue him? had not Iohn Baptiſt much to doe, to draw his diſcyples from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to bring them to Chriſt? And, when they had ſeen all thoſe great miracles, and wonders, yet would they ſcarcely in the end, geue credit vnto Chriſt: ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended were they at his baſe habit, and lowly conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. And this ran alwayes in their heads, if he had bin our true Chriſt, or <hi>Meſſias,</hi> he would haue come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a more regall, magnificent, and imperiall ſort, then thus. But how fel it out with Cleophas, and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyon? was not this prophecie verefyed, and fulfilled euen in them?<note place="margin">Euen the Apoſtles ſtaggered, &amp; douted whe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther Chriſt were Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias or no.</note> they had heard before of Chriſt, and they had ſeen his works, and great wonders. Whereupon they ſuppoſed, and iudged, that he was the true deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of Iſraell: But when they ſaw ſo much humility, and weaknes in him on good Fryday, that he ſuffered himſelf to be ſlayn, and buryed, it offended, and trobled them very much, ſo that they then began to ſtagger, and wauer, and doubt, whether he was the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> or no. It would not ſink into their heads, that Ieſus, whom they had ſeen crucified, could help other, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuer Iſraell, ſeeing that was now the third day ſince he himſelf ſuffered death vpon the cros. And theſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations ran in their heads: How ſhal he delyuer Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:16253:156"/>
from al his calamities, which ſuffered himſelf to be taken, and nayled to the cros? we beleeued that he had been the redeemer of Iſrael, but our hope is fruſtrate.</p>
                  <p>Behold how hardly the diſciples beleued the miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the goſpel, concerning the death, reſurrection, and kingdome of Chriſt. But when the women ſayd, that they had ſeen Angels at the graue: and when the diſcyples heard them ſay, that Chriſt was ryſen to life agayn, O, how ſtrange was that to them? how hardly did they beleue it? Chriſt in Luke,<note place="margin">Luke. 13 33.</note> told his diſciples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, what things ſhould happen vnto hym at Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, that is to wit, how <hi>he ſhould ſuffer, and riſe agayn the third day.</hi> But Luke ſayth, that <hi>they vnderſtood not thoſe things.</hi> So vtterly ignorant were they of all theſe things. And in the laſt of Luke, when Chriſt was ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, the diſcyples hardly beleeued that he was ryſen, and when Chriſt appeared vnto them, they thought they had ſeen ſome ſpirit, or viſion, vntil they had ſeen, and handled his true body, and eaten meat with him, and therfore it is ſayd in Eſay, <hi>to whom ſhal the Lordes arme be reueled?</hi> This arme is Chriſt the vertue, and power of God, who is eternall, infinite, and almighty. Reaſon cannot perceiue, or vnderſtand it, and therfore was it needful that it ſhould be reueled vnto our harts by the holy ſpirit, by which ſpirit onely, we are able to vnderſtand, perceiue, and beleue theſe great, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful treaſures which Chriſt hath geuen vs.</p>
                  <p>Paul to the Corinthians ſaith: <hi>The natural man nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perceiueth, nor vnderſtandeth theſe things.</hi>

                  <p>Why doth the prophet call Chriſt a branch, or root ſpringing out of a dry, and barrain ground?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>☞Vrb.</speaker>
                  <p>This may be vnderſtood two wayes. Firſt of his wonderful natiuity. For, al mankind was a dry, and barraine ground, deſtitute of the liuely water of grace. And yet of this dry,<note place="margin">we by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture barren ground, and vnfruitful.</note> and curſed ground of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind was Chriſt borne, a moſt beutyful, and bleſſed branch, and was made man in deed, without all ſpot of ſinne. Surely, ſurely, this is a very ſtrange branch,
<pb facs="tcp:16253:157"/>
which groweth out of ſuch a dry ground, and yet brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth neither blot, nor blemiſh of that curſed ground with it. He hath the nature of Adam truely, but cleane without ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it may be vnderſtood thus. It is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull that Chriſt, after he had put of that baſe habit, and humiliation, is made Lord of all things. No man would euer haue thought, that ſuch a glorious glory ſhould come of ſo vile a cros. For there was no beuty then in his fleſh, all was dry, vaded, feeble, flagge, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and weake. And therfore the prophet ſayth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, and to good purpoſe, <hi>he ſhall grow vp,</hi> or, <hi>he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended vp before him,</hi> that is, before God, becauſe he was before him a moſt beutifull branch. He was before God in the moſt ſplendent, and higheſt glory, although contemned of the world, and without beuty in his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The prophet ſaith, he was not beutiful: alas, what beuty could there be in him? his moſt bleſſed face was all to be torne, and defyled with bloud, and ſpittle, and ſo deformed, &amp; rent with thornes, that euen Pilate the Gentile wondered at their cruel dealing, and had more compaſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on him, then thoſe enuyous, &amp; blind Iewes.</p>
                  <p>In the words folowing, Eſay doth more at large ſet forth the ignominious paſſion of Chriſt, telling vs, how he was miſerably, and cruelly tormented. <hi>He was</hi> (ſayth the prophet) <hi>moſt deſpiſed, and leaſt regarded of all men.</hi> There was no account made of him, and out of doubt, in deed, the Iewes regarded him nothing, but had him in great deſpite: for they made him (being the king of glory) their mocking ſtock, and ſent him to Herod for a may game. But ſeeing that Eſay had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told thus much of Chriſt, the Iewes ought in no wiſe to haue bin offended at the contumelious, and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt, eſpecyally, ſeeing theſe things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened by the ordinance, will, and prouidence of God. And ſeeing that Chriſt yealded himſelf into the Iewes hands,<note place="margin">Ioh. 18.8.</note> of his own wil, not of compulſion.</p>
                  <p>But now harken what good he wrought by this his paſſion, and debaſing of him ſelfe. Hee bare not his owne infirmities, but oures. Wee had periſhed in euerlaſting ſhame, if he of his meere mercy, had not
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:16253:157"/>
taken compaſſion vpon vs, and born that moſt heauy burthen which came by our ſinnes, and was layd vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all mankind, to wit, if he had not taken vpon him ſelfe our calamities, which was due to al mankind for their ſins, and born them himſelf, and quite diſcharged vs of that burthen, we had dyed eternally.</p>
                  <p>And now firſt of all, learn here, that mans nature,<note place="margin">Our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corrupted</note> through ſinne, is moſt da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerouſly diſeaſed, and ſhould by eternall death haue dyed for euer, if Chriſt had not helped vs, and not borne our deadly diſeaſe, and great weaknes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it appeareth that our ſinnes, and thoſe infirmities, which proceed of ſinne was ſo great,<note place="margin">The gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſnes of ſinne.</note> ſo he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy, and ſo importable a burthen, that al mankind could not beare it, but had fainted vnder the burthen, and ſo muſt needes haue been drowned in hell. And therfore natural, and ſimply ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which being no more but ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, could not make ſatiſfaction for ſinnes. But Meſſias, who was not only true man, but alſo true God, onely both had abilitie, and ought to doe it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly it muſt needes be, both meere, and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blaſphemy, to teach that ſinnes can be done away by works, and penance, and therfore monaſteries,<note place="margin">Horrible blaſphemy to ſay good workes purge ſinne</note> and other buildings, and els whatſoeuer, was founded of that intent, end, and purpoſe, that therby they might put away ſinnes, deſerue forgeuenes, and obtayn euer laſting life. What thing ſoeuer (I ſay) was, or are done for this intent, they are moſt foule, and filthy ſects, and horible errors, &amp; therby the <hi>ſtate of our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is gretly haſarded.</hi> And looke you mark this third note wel.<note place="margin">2.

                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, learn here a true comfort. If Chriſt beare our ſinnes, and offences, then the paſſion of Chriſt is oures, and only proper vnto vs, and all his deſerts are oures, wherfore our ſinnes (if the prophet be to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued) can neuer condemne vs. For, this was the cauſe why he tooke them vpon him, that he might quite blot them all out for euer, ſo that afterward, they ſhould not at any time hurt vs. And thus, the paſſion of Chriſt is become our ſatiſfaction for ſinnes, and ſo we are dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from al our ſinnes by the death of Chriſt, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be honor, and glory for euer, Amen.</p>

                  <p>Read the hiſtory of Chriſt his paſſion, ſet down by the Euangeliſtes, and then ſhalt thou eaſely ſee the meaning of it. The Iewes falſly accuſed Chriſt, ſaying that he was a ſeducer of men, a deceauer of the people, an author of ſedition, and an enemy to the law, and a blaſphemer of God. For, in Iohn, they ſayd vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Pilat:<note place="margin">Ioh. 18.30</note> 
                     <hi>If he were not an euil doer, we would not haue delyuered him vnto thee.</hi> And therfore he was thought to haue ſinned, and ſo to haue been puniſhed, and ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of God for his ſinnes, and offences committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God. It is againſt all reaſon that there ſhould be ſuch a law, that he which hath not offended, ſhould be puniſhed, and ſuffer for another offender. Mannes reaſon ſaith,<note place="margin">Mans rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon.</note> let the offender ſuffer for his offence.</p>
                  <p>But here, by the good grace, and bountiful mercy of our God, it is otherwiſe: We had offended, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by good deſert, we ought to haue bin eternally pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: But chriſt was without fault, gilty in no point, and defyled with no ſpot, &amp; yet, euen of his great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and ardent good wil, he put himſelf in our ſtead, and for our ſakes, ſuffered that puniſhment which he neuer deſerued. And here agayn, you haue the true manhood of Chriſt, becauſe you ſee in very deede, he ſuffered for vs, and tooke our ſinnes vpon him on the cros.</p>
                  <p>Therfore Eſay ſaith, God punyſhed him not for his own ſinnes, but for our ſinnes, and iniquities. It was conuenient that he ſhould be that true paſcall Lambe, which is innocent it ſelf, and without blot, but beareth
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:16253:158"/>
the offences of others of the world, and by this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Paul taketh occaſion to ſay to the Romanes,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.25.</note> that <hi>Chriſt was deliuered to death for our ſinnes.</hi> And ſo that puniſhment which we had deſerued, was layd on Chriſt, by the meere mercy, and goodnes of God, that we might haue peace. If he had not taken the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſinnes vpon him, we had neuer bin at one with God, nor the wrath of God had neuer bin appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed towards vs. We were deadly wounded, euen to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting death, neither could any other heal vs, but the wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of Chriſt, which guſhed forth of his moſt precious bloud.</p>
                  <p>No man is here excepted. For, all mankind, yea, the whole ſtock of mankind, was by the deadly poyſon of ſinne, miſerably wounded, and infected in euery part. <hi>There is none that doth good, no not one,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 14.3.</note> as the Pſalme witneſſeth. We had all gone fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy right way of truth, and innocency, into the trobleſome, rough, rugged, and erroneous wayes of falſhood, and wickednes, like wandring, and ſtraying ſheep. We all lay, euen as the half dead wounded man, which fell into the theeues handes, as he went between Ieruſalem, and Iericho. We had all of vs need of the phiſition, delyuerer, and paſtor, to ſeek for vs ſheep gone aſtray, to bring vs into the way, and to help vs, and deliuer vs. But there was none other that either could, or ſhould doe this for vs, but Ieſus Chriſt, by the mercyful, and free promiſe, which God made to vs of his ſonne in the law, and the prophets. For he was ordayned as Peter ſayth,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1.20 Our goſpel.</note> for this end, to delyuer vs. And therfore ſaith Eſay: <hi>The Lord hath laid vpon him the iniquity of vs al.</hi> This is our goſpel, and what more ioyful, and comfortable, or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter newes, can the wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, and ſorrowfull ſinner hear, then that his ſinnes are layd on Chriſt? If they be layd on him, he wil beare them, wipe them away, and blot them out. For, it is certayn that he dyed, and roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayn, to ſaue vs ſinners. And this obedience of Chriſt (in that it pleaſed him, euen as a Lamb, to be ſacrifiſed for our ſinnes, and in that he ſuffered that bitter death for vs, and all euen of his own good will, freely, with great patience) is ſo thankful, and acceptable a ſacrifice

                  <p>And leaſt we ſhould look for a corporal Citie, and an earthly kingdome at Chriſts hands, as doe the blinded Iewes, and fooliſh Cheliaſts, the prophet ſaith in the words following, that this corporall, and viſible ſun ſhal not make the gates, and walles of this Citie viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to be ſeen with bodely eyes, in the brightnes, and light of the ſonne. There muſt be a much cleerer light for the beholding of this Citie. God himſelfe ſhal ſhine in this citie, as the viſible ſun, and ſhall lighten our harts with the goſpel. And by this light may we ſee all thoſe great things, and excellent benefits, which God hath promyſed to his church.</p>
                  <p>Hereby alſo know we, that the catholick church, and the kingdome of Chriſt is not a viſible kingdome. For theſe worldly kingdomes, dominions, or politik pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, may be beholden in all their regal pomp, with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall eyes: But the church, and the beuty thereof can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſeene, but with ſpirituall eyes for an other kind of ſun muſt ſhine in it, then doth in this world.</p>
                  <p>But now mark what excellent, and comfortable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſes we haue in Chriſt. The ſun of Chriſtes king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſhal not goe down. This viſible ſun on the day time hauing runne his courſe, doth euery day goe down, and bydes himſelf til the next morning. But our ſun, and our moone tary with vs for euer. For Chriſt the ſun of righteouſnes ryſeth, and ſhineth to vs by his goſpel, and ſhall neuer goe down from his elected. For though neuer ſo great a cloud of temtation darken this ſun, yet ſhall it not vtterly goe from vs,<note place="margin">Chriſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh not his vtterly.</note> but at the laſt day of redemption, it ſhal apeare, and ſhine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs moſt cleere, where neither cloud of affliction, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, or incredulity can couer, hinder, or blemiſh his

brightnes. Then at the laſt ſhall be ſeen the fulfulling of the great promiſes of the peace, helth, and ioy of the church.<note place="margin">Our ſtate in heauen.</note> Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt our euerlaſting light, ſhalbe made many feſt, then ſhall we ſee him face to face, then ſhall our afflictions end, and then ſhall the day of eternall glory appeare to the children of God.</p>
                  <p>Note alſo here, that in the church, or kingdome of Chriſt, there ſhall be none but iuſt men. Here in the world, godly, &amp; vngodly dwel, and are mixt together, but in the true church, the congregation of Chriſtians in the ſpirit is ſuch, that there is not one vngodly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. For in the laſt day, the vngodly faithles, ſhall be euen corporally ſeperated for euer from the godly.</p>
                  <p>The fantaſticall, and mad rable of Anabaptiſts, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that they can gather together all the godly into ſome one erthly city, and that they ſhould ſo corporally fulfil this promiſe. But their conate ſhall be fruſtrate, they ſhall labour in vaine, it cannot be ſo in this earth, while this life laſteth.</p>
                  <p>At the laſt day the Tares ſhall be ſeperated from the Wheate. But here in this church, the vngodly (as theeues, and robbers in a kingdome, which abuſe all Creatures, and with violence, and iniurye, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe, and ceaſe all things into their hands,) are mixed with the godly vntil the laſt day. But the godly ſhall raign with Chriſt,<note place="margin">Rom. 8</note> in heauen, and earth. God ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently, and brauely burniſh the earth, and viſible cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature, and ſhall geue it a new ſhape, and marueilouſly beutefy it, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God may inioy it. And thus ſhall the godly inherite, and poſſes a new heauen, and a new earth,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2, 13.</note> in <hi>which righteouſnes ſhal dwell,</hi> as Peter ſaith.</p>
                  <p>But how ſhall they come to ſo great, a glory? And why ſhal they haue it?<note place="margin">Why, and how we ſhal be glorifyed.</note> Euen therfore ſhal they haue it, as Eſay ſayth, becauſe they are the bud, or bowes, or young plant, which the lord himſelf hath planted with his own hand, becauſe he hath renued in vs the Image of God by his word, and his ſpirite, and hath made vs new men, and a new creature in Chriſt. In the end of this chap. Eſay promyſeth it ſhall come to paſſe, that though the church be ſmall, and rare, yet ſhall it ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:16253:170"/>
that an innumerable, and infinite number of people ſhall receaue the faith of Chriſt. And leaſt (when we ſee the true godly perſecuted, and ſlayn on heapes, and the world ſwarme with a great multitude of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, and worldlings, and the church, in comparyſon of the world, but litle, and ſtraight) wee ſhould ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doubt how this ſhould come to pas. In his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion he ſaith, that it is not mannes deed, thus glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to exalt the kingdome of Chriſt, but God himſelf ſhal doe it in his due time. For to ſee the goſpel taught, men beleue ſuch hidden miſteries, &amp; beleeuers of Gods promyſes, to relinquiſh, and contemne this world, and valyantly by death to confes Chriſt, paſſeth al mannes reſon, wiſdome, and worldly power. Theſe muſt nedes be the works of the mighty God, which by his power, and ſpirit doth work them, preſerue them, and increaſe them in vs.</p>
                  <p>Agayn, you may gather out of this prophecy, that the kingdome of Chriſt is ſpirituall, and eternall, and that it behoued him to riſe again from death, if he ſhold be the ſonne, and euerlaſting light of the godly, &amp; that we alſo ſhal riſe again, that we may in the life to come receue, and for euer enioy al theſe great promiſes made in the prophets. Whoſoeuer beleeueth this, ſorroweth not as did Cleophas, &amp; his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panion. For he knoweth that Chriſt ſhal come to delyuer Iſrael, and aduaunce it to glory. But this glory is not ſeen in this frail life, it is here but in hope, but after this life we ſhall ſee, and haue it in eternall, and perfect poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>Now ſhall you heare what Eſay propheſyeth, of the church, of vs chriſtians, and of Chriſt the Sauyour of the church, how that he ſhall come in Syon, and iuſtify the gentils: How euen the very gentils ſhall receiue Meſſias how he ſhal geue this church: faithful biſhops and paſtors, and how he ſhall gloriouſly beutefy it, and diligently co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſerue it, as his only beloued ſpouſe. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all men may plainly ſee, that though the church be here croſſed, to the end it may be made like her Lord,<note place="margin">Eſay 92.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:16253:171"/>
not reſt, vntill the righteouſnes thereof breake forth as the light, and the ſaluation therof as a burning lampe. And the gentiles ſhall ſee thy righteouſnes, and all kinges thy glory, and thou ſhalt be cald by a new name, which the mouth of the Lord ſhall name. Thou ſhalt alſo be a croun of glory, in the hand of the Lord, and a roiall diade<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the hand of thy God. It ſhall no more be ſayd vnto thee, forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, neither ſhall it be ſayd any more to thy land, deſolat, But thou ſhalt be called <hi>Hephzibah,</hi>
                     </hi> That is to ſay my delight in her, <hi>and thy land <hi>Beulah.</hi>
                     </hi> That is to ſay: inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited. <hi>For the Lord delighteth in thee, and thy land ſhall haue a huſband. For as a young man marieth a virgine, ſo ſhall thy ſons mary thee: and as a bridgrome is glad of the bride, ſo ſhall thy God reioyce ouer thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the prophet ſayth, a great part of men regard neither God, nor Chriſt, and yet ſhall the elect, ſeeke for the ſpirituall, and true Sion, and waight for Chriſt their onely Sauiour. But ſeing the Church lyeth open to Sathans perſecutions, and of him is afflicted, and waſted, it hath great neede to be comforted.</p>
                  <p>Therefore he ſayth, I will not keepe ſilence, but I will teach Chriſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually, vntill he come. For Chriſt as Paule witneſſeth, is the <hi>onely righteouſnes of Sion,</hi> or of the ſpirituall Hieruſalem.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.30</note> And he is the onely ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the Church,<note place="margin">Pſal. 37, 39.</note> as the Euangeliſts, and Apoſtls teach in euery place. Eſay therfore teacheth of none but Chriſt Ieſus, whome God ſent vs to be our Sauiour, that both Iewes, and Gentiles might enioy, and be partakers of this his benefite: as it hath ben fulfilled in all places,<note place="margin">The new name.</note> euer ſince thapoſtles tyme. And this new name here ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of, is nothing els, but that Gos peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is now called the Church of the ſonne of God, and the true, and heauenly Hieruſalem, which is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all the elected ſaintes.</p>
                  <p>And heare behold how precious, and deare a darling, the Church is to God, our good and faithfull father. For the prophet calleth it a crowne of glory, the worlde counted the godly, as vngodly, as fooles, as doultes, as outcaſts, and as of ſcouringes of all thinges, &amp; eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, did ſcoffe, mocke, ſcorne, and iniury the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at their pleaſure. But the Church hath here an other manner
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:16253:171"/>
of name, for it is called a beloued, precious,<note place="margin">Comfort vnder the cros.</note> &amp; glorious crowne, my delight is in her, and a people that hath a god, that will not forget them. Theſe be moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble promiſes, when we be vnder the croſſe: But they muſt be ſtedfaſtly beleued, or els they little auailed. For it is moſt certaine (although in this world we be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, and afflicted) that God yet loueth vs ſo dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and wel, that al the creatures of the world are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to ſerue, &amp; helpe vs, euen then, when the world ſuppoſeth they muſt torment vs. Yea the Angels in heauen care for, cheriſh, and defend vs, and God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe beareth vs in his armes, as doth the louing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his onely beloued childe.</p>
                  <p>But now conſider this great worke of the loue of God, I meane the paſſion of Chriſt, and that God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came man for vs. All theſe thinges he did for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church to the end, that hauing deliuered them by this meanes from all euills he might bring them to health, &amp; lyfe euerlaſting.

                  <p>Though this infirmitie, ſore temptation, and cros of ours in this world, appeare outwardly, horrible,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.10,</note> and deteſtable, yet in deede thy are nothing els, but a Fatherly rod, wherewith he correcteth, amendeth, and reformeth his derely beloued children. As for the glory, which in the day of redemption ſhall be reuealed vnto vs, I wil now ſay nothing of it, but the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſhal appeare, how dearely God loueth his church. And then ſhall it be ſeene, that this temporall trouble, which we Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians haue heare, is a certaine ſigne of Gods great good will, and true fatherly loue towardes vs. Eſay his wordes ſeeme to ſound, as though he ſpak of that earthly Ieruſalem in the land of Canaa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.<note place="margin">Troble and vexation a ſigne that we be gods children.</note> And the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet beholding the Church with ſpirituall eyes, is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled to ſpeake as if he ſpake of theſe earthly thinges becauſe they were figures of the true, and heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and land of righteouſnes</p>
                  <p>As Peter, and Paul, doe ſufficiently witneſſe, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing

vs a ſure rule, how to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the prophets aright, when they ſpeake of Chriſt, and his kingdome the church. Note alſo that Eſay calleth the church ſuch a crowne, as is in the hand of the Lord, or which is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the Lordes hand. Whiche is as much to ſay, as the Church is a ſpirituall kingdome, which God himſelfe doth gouerne, and rule. It is alſo a crowne of glory, or a glorious crowne in the hand of the Lord, becauſe it doth not appeare glorious in the eyes of the world. And wheras the prophet taketh his ſimilitude of a mariage, and of fayth geuen betwene man, &amp; wife, that is very comfortable.</p>
                  <p>For hereby we learne how dearely, tenderly, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly God loueth vs, &amp; what infinite treaſures we ſhall receaue of him.

                  <p>But let vs now goe to the <hi>63.</hi> chapter of Eſay, in which the magnificall, and glorious tryumph of Chriſt is deſcrybed, to wit, how by his cros, &amp; bloudſheding, he marueilouſly ouercame his, and the churches ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, namely, ſinne, death, Sathan, and the ſinagogue of the vnbeleeuing Iewes, and valiantly vanquiſhed them by his own ſtrength, and vertue. Eſay in this chapter alſo vſeth (after his maner) a figuratiue ſpeech, ſaying: <hi>Who is this that commeth from Edom with red garments from Boſrah?

                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:16253:173"/>Here the prophet wondering at the paſſion of chriſt, vſeth an interrogatiue ſpeech. Edom ſignifyeth red,<note place="margin">Edom.</note> ruddy, or redly colored. Boſrah ſignifyeth a vine branch from whence the cluſters of grapes be gathered, which are troaden, and preſt in the wine pres. He calleth the Sinagogue of the Iewes Edom, or red, becauſe they all beſtayned, and defyled them ſelues with the bloud of the prophets, and Chriſt, when they ſayd, <hi>his bloud be vpon vs, and our children.</hi> The prophet therfore,<note place="margin">Chriſts bloud vpon the Iewes.</note> ſaw in the ſpirite, how that bloudy Sinagogue tormented, &amp; afflicted Chriſt, &amp; all be ſlubbered, and berayd him in blod, as we ſee the grape treders are beſprinkled, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaind with the wine in the vintage. He ſaw alſo, in the ſame place, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit, what Chriſt by his blodſheding hath wrought, and done: to wit, how he hath by his own ſtrength, and vertue, without the help and ayd of any other, ouercome, and vanquyſhed his enemyes, &amp; admirably tryumphed, as a moſt fortunat, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy warryar, in his triumphes, conqueſt, and ſignes of victory, worthy to be beholden of all men. For when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes thought verely he had been diſpatched, and deead in deed, then roſe he again from death, and began his kingdome, and declared him ſelfe to be a valyaunt vanquiſher of ſinne, death, and all the kingdome of darcknes, and puniſhed (with the horrible plague of captiuity, hardnes of hart, and apoſtacy) the Iewes in all the world wherſoeuer they be, for this horrible, and cruel fact of ſheding of innocent bloud.</p>
                  <p>Vnto this interrogatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the prophet, doth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as anſwere: ſaying: I ſpeake in righteouſnes, and am mighty to ſaue. That is to ſay, why marueileſt thou what I am? I am he whom God hath ſent to teache righteouſnes, nay euen to help, that is to ſay, iuſtifye, and ſaue of mine own hability. But by and by the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phet addeth another interrogation.</p>
                  <p>If thou be the true Sauyour, which ſhalt help, and geue life in deede, wherfore then is thy apparrell red, and thy garmentes like his that treadeth in the wine pres? How doth this agree, and ſtand with thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſes, wherin thou takeſt vpon thee to help, and ſaue vs? To this Chriſt anſwereth. <hi>I haue troaden the wine

pres alone, and of all people there was none with me, for I will tread them in mine anger, and tread them vnder foot in my wrath, and their bloud ſhalbe ſprinkled vpon my garments, and I wil ſtayn all my rayment. For the day of vengeance is in my hart, and the yeare of my redeemed is come, and I looked, and there was none to help, and I wondered that there was none to vphold. Therefore mine own harme helped me, and my wrath it ſelf ſuſtayned me. Therfore I wil tread down the people in my wrath, and make them dronken in mine indignation, and will bring down their ſtrength to the earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this anſwere of Chriſt, we ſee how he would by his paſſion enter into his glory, and thorowly delyuer vs for euer. He ſayth, thou ſhalt not maruail to ſee my rayment red. For this is the true, and redyeſt way, and meanes to ſaue the world, &amp; God hath ſo ordayned it. <hi>I haue troade<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wine pres alone,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone trod the wine pres.</note> that is to ſay: I alone haue born the ſinnes of the world vpon the croſſe. No man els was able to ſatiſfy God for the ſinnes of the world, but I alone. It was my bloud only, that both could, and ought to doe it, and nothing els. There was no other meanes, nor way to ſaue you from your ſins. And in that my infirmity I ſhewed great ſtrength, and I haue troaden down the hugeſt, and moſt deadly ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of man, I haue ouercome them, and deſtroyed them, and I haue vanquyſhed Sathan, with all his <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> his falſe deceate, malice, and trouble, which he hath brought into the world, for the deſtroying of man. And whereas the vnbeleeuing ſinagogue reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me, and could not abide to acknowledge me for their Lord, I haue ouercome Sathan which blinded the Iewes. And I am placed in heauen, Lord of all creatures in heauen, and in earth, to take iuſt ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geance vpon thoſe that wil not beleue. And now haue I won vnto me the Gentils to be mine own peculiar people. This haue I done onely by mine own ſtrength, and power, as Paul witneſſeth to the Coloſſyans. And in mine anger haue I duely puniſhed mine enemies,<note place="margin">Colloſ. 2.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I haue with zeale taken vpon me, and fulfilled the miniſtery, which my father hath committed vnto me, and haue ſo confounded the Iewes, that they haue
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:16253:174"/>
loſt all the dignitie, priuiledge, and prerogatiue, that before they had. <hi>This day of reuenge,</hi> and deliuerance, is the time when Chriſt ſuffered the Iewes to be blinded, and diſperſed: and receued the gentils to fauor in their place, by the doctrine of the goſpel, whereby he brake the head of the old ſerpent,<note place="margin">Mat. 12.21.</note> and beſtowed the victory that he had gotten vpon the gentils, and tooke away from the ſinagogue, all the knowledge, and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the ſcriptures.</p>
                  <p>Now he holdeth on to ſpeake of his paſſion, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony which he ſuffered for our ſakes, ſaying: <hi>I looked about me,</hi> to wit, in the time of his paſſion, and weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, <hi>and there was none to help me,</hi> there was not one that either would, or could help me. I had none on my ſide, no man helped me, yet I helped my ſelf. No mans ſtrength could doe me good but mine own. I held me by mine own arme. In mine own zeale did I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, deliuer, and rayſe vp my ſelfe, &amp; now I am king, and now doe I puniſh them that deſpyſed me, and I take from them their ſtrength, &amp; ability, and els what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer I had geuen them, as the ſcriptures, and euery other excellent, and great gift, wherein they excelled o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations.</p>
                  <p>This prophecy is now manifeſtly fulfilled in our ſight. Behold, the Iewes in theſe our dayes, how ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant they are of the ſcriptures, and how far from the vndrſtanding of the law, and promiſes in Chriſt. They vnderſtand the law carnally, and they preſume (but in vayn) that they are able without the help of Chriſt to fulfill the law, not knowing, like blind men as they be, that they cannot doe it without the helpe of Chriſtes ſpirite. They ſee not that the promiſes of Chriſt ſpeake of the ſpirituall kingdome, and that the Law is but a ſcholemaſter vnto Chriſt, in whom we are only bleſſed, iuſtifyed, and the law fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>Thus theſe two diſcyples, Cleophas, and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, ſhould in this caſe haue thought with them ſelues. It pleaſed Meſſias once willingly to dy, and to ſuffer the ſinagogue to kil him, for ſo is Gods ordy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and Chriſts wil, and the prophets fortold it, and Chriſt alſo to his diſcyples long before his death, how
<pb facs="tcp:16253:175"/>
he determyned to delyuer his children from death, by this kind of death, and he alſo told them, that he would riſe agayn the third day from death.</p>
                  <p>But now let vs ſee what ſhall become of the phary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees,<note place="margin">The puniſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of thoſe chriſt-killers.</note> and proud prelates, and let vs ſee how this their deteſtable deed ſhall in them be puniſhed. Their ioy ſhall not continue long, no not three dayes. For, after three dayes Chriſt ſhall riſe agayn to life, and ſhake of death, and in his fury tread down, ouerthrow, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy theſe bloudſuccors, and ſpoyl them of their victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which they thought (but falſly) they had gotten of him. And when they count themſelues ſure, and thinke themſelues conquerors, then without any hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery, ſhall they vtterly loſe all they haue, both law, prophets, lands, city, &amp; temple, and they ſhall be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with continall calamity, horible deſtruction, and vtter ſubuertion of all their Iudaiſme, and ſo pay for the bloudy coate of Chriſt. The phariſees, and Chriſts killers haue good cauſe to ſorrow, ſeeing they haue brought vpon their own heads ſuch horrible puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and greeuous wrath, and yet haue done Chriſt no harme. But we, in ſo much as he is riſen again, may wel reioyce, be glad, ſing, and comfort our ſelues in his reſurrection. For, Chriſt hath by his death deſtroyed death, and redeemed Iſrael. But the natural man doth not vnderſtand theſe ſupernaturall things. The ſpirite of Chriſt muſt in theſe matters be our Maſter, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructor.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>You heare in this propheſy that Ieruſalem grones vnder her croſſe, becauſe ſhe is ſo miſerably, and hotly perſecuted, and troubled here in the earth. But God promiſeth that there ſhall be ſuch plentifull comfort in the heauenly Ieruſalem, that the faythfull beleeuers ſhall not remember their former griefes. He vſeth a figuratiue ſpeach, ſaying, lyke as a hungry ſucking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant greedely draweth his mothers breſtes with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and thinketh nothing ſweeter then his mothers milke: ſo ſhall there be breſts of all comfort in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church by which the faythfull ſhall take moſt pleaſaunt repaſt, and pleaſure. For the Church in this lyfe, hath the moſt pleaſaunt, and hony ſweete milke of Gods promiſes which the children of God ſuck, and with which they are nouriſhed, and battned in fayth, and by which they are vnſpeakeably, and vncredibly comforted in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, which doth inwardly illuminate, and teach them the miſteries of the goſpell. And though the Churche here vpon earth, be afflicted, tormented, and toſſed with troubles, and hath no reſting place, yet doth god promiſe it great, plenteous, and eternall peace, which as a flowing riuer, whoſe courſe is neuer ſtayed, ſhall neuer be dried. For the kingdome of Chriſt is a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of eternall peace, whiche wee haue with God through Chriſt. And as the tender mothers nouriſhe and beare their young infantes in their laps &amp; armes: ſo do the paſtors in the kingdome of Chriſt beare the faythfull Chriſtians, and they faythfully miniſter, and truely breake to them the pure, and ſound foode of the word of God, and geue to euery one, as well weake as ſtrong according to their neede. Neither was there euer yet vpon this earth any parents (though they were moſt pampering, and fond of their children) that could ſo ſweetly intreate, ſo delicatly nurſſe, or ſo dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loue, &amp; ſo faythfully, carefully, &amp; watchfully looke to their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as God doth to vs. And therfore though y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church of the faythfull lye ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to euery croſſe, &amp; cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity after her chriſts exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple: yet is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> force of theſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly promiſes ſuch in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> middeſt of theſe troubles, that

                  <p>Why doth Chriſt here ſay, that he perceiued not, or knew not their wicked, and malicious pretences ſeeing he him ſelf told his diſciples lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g before his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that he muſt ſuffer at Ieruſalem, and knew euery thing the Iewes ment, and deuiſed againſt him?</p>

                  <p>S. Hiero<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> taketh the meaning of this text thus, that Chriſt ſaw in him ſelf no ſinn, or knew him ſelf to be <hi>gilty of no ſin,</hi> as Eſay ſaith.<note place="margin">Eſay. 53.6.</note> But although this may
<pb facs="tcp:16253:182"/>
be ſo read, and vnderſtood, yet do I take it to be meant of Ieremy him ſelf, againſt whom the Iewes at Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoth toke ſuch diueliſh, deadly, and priuy counſell, as he had not vnderſtoode of, if God had not reuealed it to him. It is ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that Ieremy be a figure of Chriſt in the chief point, that is to ſay, in his paſſion: for it is not needful that he ſhould in euery word beare the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Chriſt, and his ſayings.</p>
                  <p>The Iewes pretence was, that they might vtterly extinguiſh Chriſt, and put him out of remembrauce. As for example, when we abhorre any kind of fruite, wee grub vp, and deſtroy the tree, root, bole, branches, fruit and all, ſo that it neuer bud, or bloſſome again. S. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome hath it thus. <hi>Let vs throw wood vpon his bread.</hi> Which words in the church, were euer yet to thys day, thus expounded, let vs lay a cros vpon his body, and crucifye him. And Chriſt calleth his <hi>fleſh meate, and bread of life.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 16.55.</note> And afterward, Chriſt ſpeaketh after the property, and condition of mans nature, which for vs he tooke vpon him, and ſayth: thou Lord art iuſt, thou knoweſt they doe me wrong, to thee I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit my cauſe. And ſo he prayed in the garden at the mount Olyuet, <hi>thy will be done, O Father.</hi> And his prayer was heard, and he was obedient vnto his father, and redemed vs. For though they crucifyed him in his infirmity,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 13.4</note> which willingly in the time of his ſtuardſhip, he tooke vpon him for our ſakes, yet by the power of his Godhead, he doth liue, and ſit at the right hand of God, being Lord both of Iewes, and Gentils: and he beholdeth the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed, and ſtraying Iewes (which know not how to repent) wandering now aboue <hi>1570</hi> yeares, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, diſtracted, and blinded vagaboundes, ſo that they be more odious, and vile then dogs.</p>
                  <p>Ieremy in the <hi>16.</hi> chapter, propheſyeth of the calling of the gentils,<note place="margin">Ier. 16.19.</note> how they ſhould beleue in Chriſt. Theſe be his words. <hi>O Lord thou art my ſort, and my ſtrength, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the Gentiles ſhall come vnto thee from the ends of the world, and ſhall ſay: ſurely our fathers haue inheryted lyes, and vanities, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there was no profite.</hi> Before, he ſayd that Chriſt ſhold call the Gentils, and ſhould make them his ſpirituall
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:16253:182"/>
kingdom: theſe were his words: <hi>Behold, I wil ſend many Fiſhers (ſaith the Lord) and they ſhal fiſh them.</hi> This was fulfilled in the Apoſtles, amongſt whom,<note place="margin">Ier. 16.16.</note> the moſt part were fiſhers of fiſhes, but afterward were made fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of men, as we reade in Mathew, where Chriſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them, ſaying: <hi>Follow me, and I wil make you fiſhers of men.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 4.19.</note> Here it appeareth that he went not about to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect a worldly kingdome, for that requireth other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men then fiſhers.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>32.</hi> of Ier. there is an excellent co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phecy of Chriſt, foretelling what kind of king, &amp; king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, he, and his ſhould be, and how he ſhould rule it. In that place he cheefly threateneth to puniſh the ſalſe prophets, which did not preach the word of God pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and faithfully to the people, ſaying:<note place="margin">Ier. 20.1.</note>

Reg. 6.12.</note> meaning that he is true, and naturall man, of the ſtock, and bloud of Dauid, like as the Lord had pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>myſed to Dauid. This prophecy ſpeaketh of Meſſias, euen as the Iewes themſelues doe teſtify. For Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thas ſaith in his Thargum. <hi>Kemle Dauid Meſchiah Dera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dikia,</hi> that is, I will rayſe vp vnto Dauid that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Meſſias: if therfore, he be true man of the ſtock of Dauid, what maruel is it if firſt he dyed, and yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles he had power, and ought to delyuer, and iuſtify Iſraell, and to redeem the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>m fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all their miſeries? The greateſt, and extreemeſt calamity, is to lye captiue in ſinne, and death, and therfore was it meete, that this king, the ſonne of Dauid, ſhould delyuer Iuda, and Iſrael, that is, the twelue trybes of the Iewes, with al true Iſraelites, that is to ſay, right beleeuers from ſinne, and death, or els had they neuer been deliuered.
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:16253:183"/>
And here alſo it followeth, that he ſhould riſe agayne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death, which thing was vnto him eaſy. For he was not onely right natural man, of the ſtock of Dauid, but true, and naturall God: and therfore ſaith Ieremy, his name ſhall be called <hi>Iehouah or Adonai:</hi> that is, God him ſelf. For the Iewes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues teach, &amp; the ſcripture af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, that this word <hi>Iehouah</hi> can be rightly geuen to no creature, but only to God him ſelf, of whom al crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures haue their beginning, as you haue heard. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was meet that he ſhould be a king, far differing from thoſe which had been before him, and raigned in the ſeat of Dauid. For Ieremy ſaith, that he ſhall exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute iuſtice, and iudgement in the earth through the whol world, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne, &amp; deſtroy the wicked, &amp; make them which were vniuſt and ſinful, very pure, &amp; righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. For his kingdome is a kingdome of true iuſtice, and innocency. And Iuda, &amp; Iſrael, that is, both thoſe people ſhall haue help of him: not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the x. tribes ſhold returne out of Aſſiria, into Samaria, and there haue a king of their own, and ſet vp a corporall kingdome, as Iudah had before time in Ieruſalem, when they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vnder Dauid, and Salomon, with peace, and quy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnes: but that they ſhold haue a ſpiritual help through Chriſt, who ſhould deliuer them from ſinne, and death, that ſo they might dwel <hi>boldly, and ſafely,</hi> that is, that they might haue their conſciences quyeted, appeaſed, and mery, as men which now by faith in Chriſt, haue their ſinnes forgeuen, &amp; are at peace with God through Chriſt. So that they need not dread, nor feare death, or any other euill, becauſe that this wiſe king, the moſt pure, and floriſhing bloſſome of righteouſnes, is made the righteouſnes of all Chriſtians, that all faithfull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers, the ſpirituall Iſraell, conſiſting both of the Iewes, and Gentils, may through faith, receiue the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, which teſtifyeth in their harts that they are the children of God, heyres of God, and coheires with Ieſus Chriſt, and ſo with bouldnes of ſiprite,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.38.</note> ſay with Paul: <hi>We are perſwaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate vs from the loue of God,

                     <note place="margin">Iohn. 3.14.</note>Is not this a famous help? and a ſtrong, and firme fortreſſe for the godly? that they can ſay, <hi>we know that we are tranſlated from death vnto life?</hi> That is, the holy ſpirite hath taught vs by the word, and heauenly vnc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that Chriſt hath freed vs both from ſinne, and death, and that we (by him) after death, ſhall riſe from death, and liue for euer. This is that hope of Iſraell which neither Gentil, nor Infidel hath. Now marke what noble, and miraculous works of diuinity (which none could doe but very God him ſelfe) the prophet aſcrybeth to this ſonne of Dauid. He ſayth: <hi>He ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute, and ſet vp iuſtice, and iudgement in the earth.</hi> And he ſhall iuſtify others. Ergo he muſt not only outward<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, but alſo inwardly purge the hart, and forgeue ſinne, And this is only the worke of God. For it is he onely that can change a wicked, and malicious hart, and it is he which can illuminate, and regenerate vs, and none but he. And agayn, if he can forgeue ſinnes, he can alſo aboliſh death,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.56</note> which is the reward, or ſtipend of ſinne, and the <hi>ſting</hi> of death. If then he could ouercom death, and make vs righteous, and geue vs euerlaſting life, he is true God, which can only in deed deliuer vs from our ſinnes, and eternall death, and geue, and preſerue true tranquility, and peace.</p>
                  <p>If then Iudah, and Iſraell, that is, the hole church of the godly, ſhall be delyuered from their ſinne, and death: then muſt it needes follow, that they ſhall liue with Chriſt for euer. Here then in this prophecy (if we marke it wel) we may ſee that Chriſt ſhould dye as the naturall ſonne of Dauid: but not abide in death, but that he ſhould iuſtify, and ſaue Iudah, and Iſrael, that is to ſay, his people, the godly, and faithful. And for this cauſe ſhould he firſt riſe again from death, that he might rayſe his Iſraelites, that is, his faithful from death, and that he might purchaſe for them, and geue them eternal life, &amp; ſecuritie for euer. For if he ſhould haue geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them peace but for a time, he ſhould not truely, and in deede, haue delyuered them: neither were it a true tranquility and peace. Wherfore it was neceſſary, that that peace and ſaluation, which he ſhould geue his elect, ſhould
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:16253:184"/>
continue for euer, and euer.</p>
                  <p>Thus then in this ſhort prophecy haue we this eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall king, together with his death, reſurrection, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting kingdome, expreſly, and ſoundly deſcrybed.

                  <p>Cleophas,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1.17.</note> and his companion vnderſtoode not this. For if they had, they would neuer haue been ſo heauy, but haue thought this with them ſelues. The time is now come, wherin our Iudaiſme, with our ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies ſhall haue an end, and Ieſus of Nazareth by his wonders hath declared him ſelf to be the true Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias. Surely Ieremy propheſyeth, that the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (when the fulnes of time ſhould come) ſhould be abrogated, and the new couenant of grace ſhould take place. And this muſt be confirmed by bloud, but not by the bloud of ſheep, and calues, but by the death of Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias, as Eſay, and Danyel witnes. And this couenant which God made with the people of God, ſhall conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue for euer. This is that true delyuerance of Iſraell. And now at the laſt ſhall the kingdome of Iſraell in deed be rightly reſtored, erected, &amp; eſtabliſted for euer. God wil not recant this, and therfore muſt it needes be done, becauſe God hath ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it. And as he hath not hetherto altered the courſe of the day, and night: euen
<pb facs="tcp:16253:189"/>
ſo wil he not change this his promiſe. To be ſhort, the hope of Iſraell ſhall not be fruſtered, but as we truſt, ſo (according to the promiſe of God) ſhall it come to pas. For God ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not lye, neither did he make this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe vpon any ſuch condition, that our ſaluation ſhold conſiſt vpon our works, and therfore it is ſound, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and ſure. And therefore muſt Iſraell, and Iuda needes be ſaued, and Chriſt aryſe again from the dead, that he might preach, and publiſh the new couenant.</p>

                  <p>You ſay wel. And ſeeing that the circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and other rites were to be abrogated, they might eaſely haue coniectured, that the kingdome of Iſraell could no more ſtand, or tary, then the externall prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode with his outward, and figuratiue ceremonies. Wherupon it may wel follow, that the Gentiles alſo, ſhould haue acceſſe vnto Meſſias, &amp; be receaued into his ſpirituall kingdome.

                  <p>None in deed at all, but as Peter ſaith, God ordayned from the beginninning, that the goſpel ſhold be preached euen to the gentils, and that they ſhould become as faithfull chriſtians, as Abraham, Iſaac, Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, and the Patriarches, &amp; Apoſtles were. For, God promyſed that he would receaue them into his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, for he beſtowed on them the holy Ghoſt, as wel as on the Iewes. Neither did he after make any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwen the Iewes, and Gentils. The ſtop of the partiſion wal is broken down, and the Lord hath clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the harts of the gentils through faith: ſo that now Chriſtians, or the church of the faithful, are onely the people of God, without any further differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and they are (as Chriſt ſaith) faithful only ſaued. Neither can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man be ſaued any other way, but only by the grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>This is the foundation of our faith. And wheras Ieremy promyſed afterward, that al from the leaſt vnto the greateſt, ſhould know the Lord in his new teſtament: you muſt vnderſtand it of all the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, which are the children of promiſe. For to them the Lord geueth the catholick faith, and the holy ſpirite by his goſpel: and he draweth them, that they may come vnto Chriſt, and that his ſpirite may teach them, and they know the voice of their ſhepheard, and follow not any ſtrange teacher.</p>
                  <p>Now harken how Ezechiel propheſieth of the time of the office, and of the kingdome of Meſſias, in his <hi>11.</hi> chapter, where he hath theſe words:<note place="margin">Eze. 11.17.</note> 
                     <hi>Thus ſaith the lord God, I wil gather you again from the people, and aſſemble you out of the countreis where you haue been ſcattered, and I wil geue you the land of Iſrael, and they ſhall come thether, and they ſhall take away all the Idols thereof, and all the abhominations therof from thence.

                  <p>Ezechiel, when the Lord had rayſed him vp to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy of theſe thinges, doth comfort the Iewes beyng priſoners in Babilo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by this propheſy.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage that they were in, and bring them ſafely into their owne country to Ieruſalem: which thinges came ſo to pas in deed in the dayes of Zerubabel, Iehoſchua, Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras and Neemias when they ſhould no more commit Idolatry with Babell and other Idols, as before they had done. But this deliuerance out of the captiuitie in Babilon was but onely a ſigne of our true deliuerance by Chriſt, wherby all priſoners, and ſuch as remayne captaynes are at the laſt truely deliuered, and ſaued,<note place="margin">Captiuitie of Babilon.</note> as ſoon as they caſt away their vngodlines and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and imbrace the true Chriſtian fayth.</p>

For Chriſt is the only alone Phiſition of our heauy, ſick, and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounded nature. He alone regenerateth vs with his ſpirit, he healeth vs, and he reſtoreth vs agayn, and he onely is our interceſſor, who putteth away and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueth from vs the wrath of God, and reconcileth vs vnto the Father: ſo that with a fatherly hart and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he embraceth vs and maketh vs hys children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt hath both purified our hart, pardoned our ſinnes, and brought vs into fauour with the father a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne.

                  <p>This is the way and meane by which Chriſt plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and preſerueth his ſpirituall kingdome, when of ſinners hee maketh godly and righteous perſons, and geueth them new harts, and lightneth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by his word and holy ſpirit, and reneweth them, that they may be in the inward man enclined with a redy delight and ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critie to do the will and pleaſure of God.<note place="margin">Deu. 10.16.</note> This is the meaning of Moyſes in Deutrinomy when he comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s by the galouſes, torments, wheeles, ſwords, halters, and other puniſhments: and yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all ſuch executions, and torments, the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and raſh bouldnes of louſe liuers can ſcarcely be brideled. For ſo ſoon as the hart perceiueth that it hath got licence, and time,<note place="margin">A deſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the godly.</note> by and by it turneth to the olde habit, and committeth what lewdnes it liſteth. But Chriſt goeth to work after another, and better ſort. For he changeth, and cleanſeth the hart from euil to good, which when he hath once puryfied, and changed, there followeth by and by, honeſty, holynes, and integrity of life in outward conuerſation. And thus doth he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue thoſe which are indued with true innocency, and through faith are drawen cheerefully by a harty deſire, to work all kind of vertue.</p>
                  <p>And thus doth this our king raign ſpiritually, and by his word, and ſpirit, preuayleth more then al kings, and Caeſers in this world can doe by compulſion, and all kind of torments, though they be neuer ſo cruel,</p>
                  <p>Ezechiel alſo hath a prophecy, and promiſe of this day of ſaluation, and new league of grace,<note place="margin">Ezec. 36.25.</note> in his thirty ſix chapter, in playn wordes ſaying. <hi>Then will I power clean water vpon you, and ye ſhall be clean, (yea) from all your filthynes, and from all your Idols wil I cleanſe you.</hi> Here the prophet promiſeth the ſacrament of baptiſme,<note place="margin">The ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiſme.</note> which is moſt pure and clean water, becauſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God, of which it dependeth, and hath his excellency. And therfore it is caled in Titus,<note place="margin">Titus. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>The lauer of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the holy Ghoſt,</hi> which God, in baptiſme, by Chriſt our Sauyour, poureth plentifully vpon vs, that we by his grace (being iuſtifyed) may through hope, be made heires of euerlaſting ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>This was then fulfilled, when the diſcyples bapty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the people, and forgaue ſinnes in the name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt and when the cleanſed, and godly congregation of the faithfull Chriſtians was firſt erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who firſt rightly found forth the Lord God, and were dayly more, and more increaſed? as we read in the Actes, that the ſpirituall kingdome of Chriſt by his word, did daily more, &amp; more increaſe, though in their bodyes they ſuffered great perſecutions, and dangers,
<pb facs="tcp:16253:191"/>
And this was the way, and maner, by which Chriſt wold gouern his kingdome. But the blinded Iewes thought that all theſe thinges ſhould carnally be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, &amp; that Meſſias wold rule his kingdome in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pompe, and power.</p>
                  <p>God in the <hi>34.</hi> chapter of Eze. promyſeth his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a true ſhepherd, which hath good and holſome pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, &amp; which will keep his ſheep faithfully, &amp; defend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> carefully. Which things the pharyſies, &amp; faithles ſhepheards in Iuda did not,<note place="margin">Eſe. 34.23.</note> but fed and fatted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. The prophets words be theſe. <hi>And I wil ſet vp a ſhepheard ouer them, and he ſhal feed them, euen my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant Dauid, he ſhall feed them, and he ſhall be their ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, and I the Lord wil be their God, and my ſeruant Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid ſhalbe the prince among them. I the Lord haue ſpoken it. And I wil make with them a couenant of peace, and wil cauſe the euil beaſtes to ceaſe out of the land, and they ſhal dwel ſafely in the wildernes, and ſleep in the woods. And I wil rayſe vp for them a plant of renown, and they ſhall be no more conſumed with hunger in the land, neither beare the reproch of the heathen any more. Thus ſhall they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that I the Lord their God am with them, &amp; that they, euen the houſe of Iſrael, are my people, ſaith the Lord God.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This ſhepheard is that Meſſias, whom Ezechiell calleth Dauid, becauſe he ſhould be borne of Dauides ſtock. And the Iewes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues agree with vs in this point. For Dauid the ſonne of Ieſſe, was dead long be fore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time. Ezechiel ſpake this prophecy in the time of the captiuity of Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnto which fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Dauid the ſon of Ieſſe his time, were <hi>14,</hi> generations, as S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine ſayth in the <hi>11.</hi> chapter <hi>de ouibus,</hi> where he expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth this prophecye.</p>
                  <p>Now you heare that this prince, or king ſhall not rule corporally, or after the maner of this world, but that he ſhall feed his people, that is, he ſhall gouerne, feed, and preſerue them by his word, as Chriſt himſelfe plainly expoundeth this prophecy in Iohn. <hi>This league</hi> ſhalbe a league of peace,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 20.</note> and ſecurity, that the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites may liue bouldly in peace, and ſafety. God will
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:16253:191"/>
neuer be angry with them, any more to deſtroy them: but they ſhall enioy quietnes in their conſciences, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any man harm them vnder this ſhepherd Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid. For the true faithful chriſtian is ſo ſafe in his faith, that none can hurt him. All creatures are forced to help him. And they ſhall know (ſaith he) or they ſhall ſee, that I the Lord their God am with them, and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them.</p>
                  <p>Was not this plainly, and truely fulfilled, when Chriſt the true Dauid, true God, and true man, fed his people him ſelf, and pardoned them their ſinnes, paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed the trobleſome ſea, healed their ſicknes, and rayſed the dead to life again? But Cleophas, and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyon could not vnderſtand all theſe things, vntil they heard the Lord himſelf, and till their eyes were opened.</p>
                  <p>Ezechiel alſo propheſyeth of Chriſt, and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and of the generall reſurrection, which ſhall be in the laſt day, in his <hi>37</hi> chapter.

And he led me round about by them, and behold, they were very many in the open field, and loe, they were very dry. And he ſayd vnto me. Sonne of man, can theſe bones liue?

                  <p>Yea forſooth.

                     <hi>Moreouer I will make a couenaunt of peace with them: it ſhall be an euerlaſting couenaunt with them, and I will place them, and multiply them, and I will ſet my ſanctuary among them for euer more.

Thus the heathen ſhall know that I the lord doo ſanctify Iſraell, when my ſanctuary ſhall be among them for euermore.</hi> This prophecy was corporally fulfilled after they had ben captiues <hi>70.</hi> years, when the Iews returned into their countrye, and aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled themſelues together, and multiplied, vntill the comming of Chriſt which was to come <hi>.490.</hi> yeares after that captiuitye: then in deede had they one king. But this propheſye
<pb facs="tcp:16253:193"/>
was truely fulfilled, in the laſt weeke ſpoken of by Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niell, at the former comming of Chriſt, when both he and his diſciples conuerted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the land of Chana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and els where, where they were diſperſed: and gathered them by the goſpell, into that onely ſpirituall ſhepfold the Church of Chriſt before times. Iudah &amp; Beniamin had a king of their owne, and the ten tribes which fell from the houſe of Dauid vnder Roboham had another king of their owne: but when Chriſt the true Dauid came, all the Iewes were made one peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, vnder one true king Chriſt. In this kingdome, ſhall not the queſtion be curiouſly aſked, whether you are of the tribe of Ruben, Leuy, Iſachar, Zebulon, Dan, Gad, or Aſhur &amp;c: but it ſhall be aſked, art thou a Chriſtian? doeſt thou acknowledge, and confeſſe Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus of Nazareth to be the true Meſſias, whom the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarkes, prophets, and all the tribes of Iſrael did loke for? They euen vnto this time, carefully looked for Chriſt. But when Chriſt himſelfe came the true ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard, and king of Iſraell, then was that euerlaſting couenaunt of grace, betwixt God and man ratified, and then that true throne of grace, wherein all fulnes of the Godhed corporally dwelleth, that is Ieſus Chriſt, true God, and true man was conuerſant here himſelfe in earth amongſt men. That ould Caporeth, and their materiall temple,<note place="margin">Chriſtians the temple of God.</note> and Leuiticall prieſthood was then no more to be regarded: for all tipes, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures then ceaſed, &amp; the truth it ſelfe appered.

                  <p>This is the circumſtaunce, and prophets drift in the propheſye afore ſayd, to perſwade, and proue this congregation of the Iſraelites, to be an euerlaſting, and ſpiritual kingdome, vnder their owne king chriſt. For the land of Canaan, Ieruſalem, and the temple were brittle, and but for a tyme euen as this viſible world is. Therefore that habitation could not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new for euer: wherefore the prophet ſpeaketh here of ſpiritual, and eternal things which cannot by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce of time decay, &amp; dy, but muſt ſtand for euer. Theſe things which are earthly, and of this world, vaniſh, &amp; decay: but the king Meſſias, &amp; his habitation, the houſe of Iacob, and his kingdome abideth for euer. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they are not earthly, nor carnall, but euerlaſting, and ſpirituall.</p>

                  <p>Yf according to this propheſye, the houſe of Iacob, or the kingdome of Meſſias ſhould be the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary of God for euer: and this ſpirituall Dauid be the king of the faythfull Chriſtians, or Iſraelites for euer, then muſt it needes follow that he ſhould riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, and gather the diſparſed Iſraelites, or children of god together, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might erect an euerlaſting king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and rayſe his people from death, and geue them lyfe, and ſaluation in euerlaſting peace. This is that true holynes, and full deliueraunce of Iſraell from all all euilles, temporall, and eternall.</p>
                  <p>If Cleophas, and his companion had vnderſtode and beleued this propheſy they would neuer haue ſaid: We thought that it had beene he that ſhould haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed Iſraell: but they would haue ſayd, we hope, and beleue, that it is he that hath, and ſhall redeeme Iſraell, although he hath now ſuffred death. For the promiſe of the Lord is ſure, and certaine, and can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer deceaue vs. Farthermore in as much, as Meſſias is called Dauid, becauſe he was born of Dauids ſtock: and in as much as he is true man, what maruaile is it, if he be ſubiect to death, and dyed? But in that he ſhould keepe, and gouerne Iſraell for euer he could not abide in death, but muſt needes riſe agayne, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to fulfill this, and other propheſies concerning

his euerlaſting kingdome. But there is one thing in this propheſye, which moueth a doubt: you ſayd ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday, that Ezechiell in this chap. did propheſye of that generall, and vniuerſall reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which ſhould be at the laſt day.<note place="margin">The houſe of Iſraell which is a figure of the houſe of Iſraell.</note> Wherefore then doth the prophet ſay that theſe dry bones were the houſe of Iſraell, which was in captiuitie at Babilon? how can you here by proue the vniuerſall reſurrection of the dead?</p>

                  <p>I confeſſe in deede that Ezechiel in this chap. doth ſpeake of the deliueraunce, and reſtitution of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell, and that he propheſieth alſo of their returne, and as it were by law, recouer their land loſt in their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. But iudge you, ſeing God by this ſimilitude would comfort his people, that they ſhould not doubt of their deliuerance, whether our reſurrection, maye not heare be gathered of this place, as a certayne, and vndoubted truth, or no. For if our reſurrection were vncertayne, and doubtfull, he could not by it haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or miniſtred vnto them any ſownd, and ſure co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. For then they would haue ſayd, loke how ſlender and ſmall hope there is that theſe bones ſhould liue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, euen ſo ſmall hope is there, that we ſhould be redeemed, out of the captiuitie of Babilon.</p>
                  <p>But here the prophet bringeth in, and alleageth the reſurrection of their bones, as a thing moſt ſure, of which no good nor godly man may doubt: euen as if he had ſayde, looke how certayne, and ſure it is, that theſe bodies ſhall riſe, and liue againe, by the power of God, euen ſo ſure alſo it is that you ſhall be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of the captiuitie of Babilon, and reſtored to your owne countrye agayne.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer wee know, that the catholicke Church both in the eaſt, and weſt, hath hetherto without all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie, by the inſtinct &amp; light of thy holy ghoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded this propheſy of the reſurrection of the fleſhe.</p>

                  <p>But let vs ſee nowe what Daniell ſayth of Chriſt: And as for thoſe things which I opened a little while a goe out of the <hi>2.</hi> and <hi>9.</hi> thap. it ſhall not bee needfull now to repeat them agayne. But in his <hi>7,</hi> chapter, he propheſieth moſt ſweetly of the kingdome of Chriſt &amp; of his ſaynts, to wit, how his kingdome ſhould be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting, propagated, and ſpread abroad throughout all the world: &amp; he ſayth,<note place="margin">Dan. 7.13.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>You know this to be a generall rule,<note place="margin">A good rule.</note> and neceſſary for the vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of the prophets wheras any thing is ſpoken in the Prophets of the eternall kingdome of Chriſt, of Chriſtifidelians, and of euerlaſting lyfe, that there we both may, and ought to grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt, &amp; faythfull Chriſtians. For if they ſhall lyue and raigne for euer, then muſt they needs riſe againe which thing Daniell prophecieth in his <hi>12.</hi> chapiter as plainely, and euidently as if ſome of the Euangeliſts had written it. This prophecy is to be referred vnto the laſt day wherein this world ſhall haue an end. And theſe be the wordes of the prophet. <hi>And at that time thy people ſhall be deliuered, euery one ſhall be found writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the booke.

But you maye ſee alſo here, that there ſhall be great difference amongeſt them which ſhall riſe.</p>
                  <p>For they which are the people of God, to wit, chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelians, which are written in the booke of lyfe, ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be deliuered from the wrath of God which ſhall come vpon the vnbeleuing, and wicked world, that is, they ſhall be deliuered from the euerlaſting puniſhment of hell, and be brought into euerlaſting lyfe. But the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, which haue not in their lyfe time beleued the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, ſhall not be ſaued, but the wrath of God ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for euer: for they haue denied to receue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tru life Chriſt Ieſus, and therfore ſhal they be confounded, and periſh for euer. Dani. alſo here deſcribeth the glory which Gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal haue after the reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">The ſtate of the elect in the world to come.</note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhal be as bright as the ſun, &amp; ſtars of the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament for euer world without end. And this out of doubt, is the true, and laſt deliueraunce of Iſraell, that is of the children of god, which we do with firme fayth and hope looke for. For as verely as all other thinges, which in the prophets are promiſed, are perfitly fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: as the birth of Chriſt, with his paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; aſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion, &amp; calling of the gentills: ſo alſo at the laſt day ſhall this be fulfilled, to wit, the reſurrection of dead with the true deliueraunce of all faythfull Chriſtians.

                  <p>Cleophas, and his companyon might here haue learned, that the kingdome of Chriſt is not an earthly kingdome, ſeeing that Hoſeas threatned vnto the gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the Iewes ſuch captiuity, that they ſhould neuer return to their wonted ſtate, or dignity of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as when they had a king of their own in Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, or Iſraell.

                  <p>God ſayth in deed, in the pſalmes,<note place="margin">Pſa. 94.24. Rom. 11.2. Pſal. 98.3</note> that he wil not reiect, or caſt of his people, and forſake his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herytance. And Paul ſaith: <hi>That God hath not caſt away his people.</hi> And the Pſalmiſt ſayth: <hi>The Lord hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred his mercy, and his truth toward the houſe of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell.</hi> Like as alſo Mary the bleſſed mother of Chriſt ſayth in her pſalme of thankeſgeuing. And Zacharye ſayth, that God will not forget his mercy, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>myſed to his people Iſraell. Know you therfore, that God is true, and conſtant in all his promyſes, and that he perfourmed vnto the Iewes all thinges which he promyſed them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:16253:197"/>But the maner of Gods promyſes muſt be marked, for they are of two ſorts. Some of them are temporal, or corporall,<note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of gods promiſes muſt be marked. and are of 2. ſortes.</note> and are made vpon condition. As when God promyſed that the land of Canaan, and the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall temple ſhould contynue, and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>Theſe promiſes pertain to Iudaiſme, and haue this condition annexed. If the Iewes would keep the law of God, as it was to be kept, then that promiſe ſhould be fulfilled:<note place="margin">1. kinde of promiſes.</note> but they kept not the law, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding being blindly bewitched, they looked for the fulfilling of thoſe promiſes. The Lord in deed perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thoſe promiſes rightly, as they were to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. But figures ought of right to geue place, when the truth commeth.</p>
                  <p>God ſent alſo his ſonne, the Meſſias, vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he might be born a Iew, of the Iewiſh family of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, &amp; Dauid. And for this his ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes ſake, he brought them out of the land of Egipt, and gaue them the land of Cannan for their inheritance: and he ſeparated them from all the people of the world by an earthly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, by an outward prieſthood, by an holy worſhip, and by a propper forme in religion, to be a people vnto himſelf: and he preſerued, and defended the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> afterward, by great, &amp; wonderfull miracles: yea, he brought them out of the captiuity of Babilon.</p>
                  <p>To be breef, he preſerued their law, religion, temple, citie, and politicall gouernment, by a ſingular care, and marueilous zeale, euen vntil the promiſed Meſſias, the true, and eternal king of Iſrael was come of them. Wherby in deed they receiued a great glory, and prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue aboue all the world, and many of them, by Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias, were deliuered from ſinne, death, and damnation, and ſo at the laſt, were brought into that true Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and Syon. And theſe are called in the prophet, the remnant of his people, the remnant of Iacob, and Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell: whom God, amongſt others, had choſen to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and predeſtinated to ſaluation in Chriſt, of which ſort there be many. But if they be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared to the great number of the vnbeleeuers,<note place="margin">2. kinde are free promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> they are but a few.</p>

Theſe doe appertayn to the new teſtament, and conſiſt in the merits, and worthynes of Meſſias. Theſe haue a firme, ſound, and vnſhaken foundation, to wit, the great, and wonderfull mercy of God, and his fatherly goodnes, and truth: and they depend not of our worthynes at all. Wherfore they are firme, and certayn, and cannot be called back agayn. And they are promiſes of the ſpirituall, and euerlaſting treaſures, to wit, of the victory, by which ſinne, death, and Sathan, were extinguiſhed, of the forgeuenes of ſinnes, of the true, and euerlaſting righteouſnes, and of life, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Theſe kind of promyſes doe not only appertayn to Iſraelites, Iudaiſme, and the Iewes according to the fleſh, but (all reſpect ſet aſide, without difference, not regarding whether they be Iewes or Gentils) to the true Iewes, &amp; Iſraelites, according to the ſpirit, which are the elect in Chriſt, the children of promiſe, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the new teſtament, without reſpect.

                  <p>But marke I pray you, wherefore the ſcripture ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth the chief patriarchs, as Abraham, and Iacob, ſo gloriouſly. It doth not commend, and ſet forth vnto vs Abraham only born of fleſh, and bloud: but Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham beleeuing in Chriſt Ieſus, regenerated by faith, and born a new, and made a new man, as Paul plainly teacheth,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.7</note> ſaying: <hi>They which are of faith, the ſame are children of Abraham. For the Scripture foreſeeing that God, by faith, would iuſtifie the Gentils,</hi> preached, before, the goſpel vnto Abraham, ſaying: <hi>In thee ſhall all the gentils be bleſſed.

                  <p>And in lyke ſort doth the ſcripture ſet forth vnto vs Iacob, not ſimple Iacob, but that Iacob which wraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the Lord, and ouercommed by fayth in Chriſt, and thereupon obtained he the glorious name to be called Iſraell, (that is) a man of great might with God, who by the Chriſtian fayth in God is with God, and through god y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord of all thinges. And theſe are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> patriarkes vnto whom, as vnto good Chriſtifidelians the ſpirituall promiſes were made, and not for their corporall circumſition, or for the law: for the law of Moyſes was geuen long after that promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Note here what the true Iſraell is: what is the true Iuda: and who be the right children of the patriarkes: and then the promiſes that were made vnto Iſraell, ſhall be more plain, and eaſy to be vnderſtood, and you ſhall better perceaue who they are, which ſhall enioye the kingdome of heauen, For Eſay ſayth. <hi>For though thy people,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Here you ſee that the promiſes are not vnderſtode of all the Iewes, or Iſraelites in Iſraell, according to the fleſh, but that a certain onely in the houſe of Iacob ſhall be deliuered by Meſſias from death, to wit, (thoſe which haue beleued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promiſes which Abraham, &amp; Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob did beleue, &amp; ſo are become the true children of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,

                  </p>
                  <p>Thou muſt vnderſtand the prophet thus. God in deed made a couenant with Abraham, &amp; his ſeed, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he promiſeth that he will be their god, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them as the ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the ſea, and not reiect them.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull miracles multiplied, and preſerued, neuer vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly leauing them vntill Ieſus Chriſt the true ſeed of Abraham came into this earth, in whome all nations were bleſſed. For when Chriſt came, and was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by the goſpel through the hole world, then was the couenant of Gods grace, which he had made with Abraham, and his ſeede, firſt publiſhed, and it began truly to be fulfilled, when an innumerable multitude of Abrams children not onely of the Iewes but euen of the Gentiles through out all the world ſprong vp by the goſpell, by which Abraham alſo himſelfe was made the child of God.</p>
                  <p>This therefore is the prophets meaning. Although the Lord caſt of the outward Iſraell, neuer minding to bring him agayne into the land of Canaan: yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>theleſſe, the great worthy promiſes of the Lord made vnto Iſraell ſhall be fulfilled, and the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell ſhall neuer the later be in number as the ſand of the ſea, and Meſſias ſhall build, and erect, a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
<pb facs="tcp:16253:199"/>
and princely kingdome: but this ſhall ſo be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that he will not raiſe vp children to Abraham of the Iewes onely, but euen of the Gentiles through out the whole world: and they ſhall be the true children of Abraham, and Iſraell, which through fayth receaue that bleſſed ſeede of Abraham, Ieſus Chriſt the true, and euerlaſting king of Iſraell. This is the notable, and worthy multiplying of Abrahams ſeede, and the children of Iſraell, which thing is wrought by the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell in fayth through the whole world, and ſhall be in working till the laſt day, vntill all be come into the kingdome of Chriſt, which ſhall come, and are elected thereunto.</p>
                  <p>This alſo is to be marked, that the kingdome of Iſraell, before the natiuitye of Chriſt, was deuided, and <hi>2.</hi> tribes onely, Iuda, and Beniamin, taryed with the houſe of Dauid, the other tribes choſe for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues a king, and the greateſt part of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> became Idolaters: but it ſhall not be ſo ſayth Hoſeas, in the dayes of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt the true king of Iſraell. For Iuda, &amp; Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, (that is) the children of promiſe, ſhall be gathered together in one fayth, and ſpirite, both out of all theſe tribes, and out of all nations, vnder the true king Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. And there ſhall dayly more, and more chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſpring out of all nations: for the kingdome of Chriſt muſt from hence forth increaſe,<note place="margin">Eſa. 9.7.</note> and grow grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and greater vntill the worldes end, whereas all earthly empires ſhall decreaſe, fall, and be deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>And Hoſe propheſieth againe in the end of the <hi>2.</hi> chapiter of the euerlaſting couenaunt of grace betwen God,<note place="margin">Hoſe. 2.18.</note> and vs, in a pleaſaunt, ſweete, and comfortable ſimilitude ſaying: <hi>And in that day will I make couenants for them, with the wilde beaſtes, and with the fowle of heauen, and with that that creepeth vppon the earth.

                  <p>You haue heard before, that Paul would not haue the Iewes deſpiſed.<note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> For they haue a promiſe of their conuerſion before the laſt day, when they ſhall become chriſtians, that is, when the Iſraelites, according to the ſpirit, to wit, the elect number of the children of God among the gentils ſhal be accompliſhed. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhall the Iewes haue their eyes opened, &amp; be gathered vnto the true Meſſias, Ieſus Chriſt, and embrace the goſpel.

                  <p>And Hoſeas in his <hi>13.</hi> chap, propheſyeth very plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Chriſt his victory, how that for our ſakes, &amp; profit he hath ouercome ſinne, death, and hel, ſaying:<note place="margin">Hoſee. 13.14.</note>

Take vnto you wordes, and turne to the Lord and ſay vnto him, take away all iniquitie, and receaue vs gratiouſly, ſo will we render the calues of our lips. Aſſhur ſhall not ſaue vs, neither will we ride vpon horſes, neither will we ſay any more to the worke of our hands, ye are our Gods: for in thee the fatherles findeth mercy. I will heare their rebellion: I will loue them freely: for my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is turned away from him. I will be as the dew vnto Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell: he ſhall grow as the lily, and faſten the rootes as the trees of Libanon.

                  <p>In the beginning of the <hi>14.</hi> chapiter, Hoſeas mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Iſraelites to repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taunce. But ſeing, that true repentaunce is the worke of the holy ghoſt in vs, and not of the naturall man, the holy ghoſt, at the end, addeth theſe notable promiſes, that Iſraell by them might be ſtirred vp, to beleue the grace which god pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, &amp; ſo receaue the power of the holy ghoſt, that he might obay the commaundements, and word of God.</p>
                  <p>Is not this promiſe full of comfort, where he ſayth: I will heale Iſraells backſliding, (that is) he will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all their offences, and neuer be angry with them any more for their ſinns? In which promiſe Chriſt, the throne of grace, is included, and comprehended. For theſe determinations of God is, that he will forgeue
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:16253:202"/>
ſin to no man, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wil loue no man, and that he wil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue none vnto grace by any other meanes, but by his deerely beloued ſonn: who is become our onely redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, mediator, reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciler, biſhop, prieſt, propiciatory, or throne of grace, as Paule affirmeth ſaying,<note place="margin">Ephe. 1.6.</note> 
                     <hi>We are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in his beloued, by whome we haue redemption, through his bloud, euen the forgeuenes of ſinns, according to his rich grace.</hi> It is manifeſt therfore by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firme fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the apoſtles doctrine, that Hoſeas here ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of Chriſt, although he name him not: ſeing that there is no other reconciler, which can turne the wrath of God from vs, but onely Ieſus Chriſt. Wherefore I haue often ſayd, that where the Lord promiſeth his grace, redemption, forgeuenes of ſinns, righteouſnes, lyfe, and health, that there is Ieſus Chriſt promiſed: by whoſe death, and pretious bloud, we are reconciled to God the father, and receaue forgeuenes, remiſſion of our ſinns, true righteouſnes, and lyfe euerlaſting.</p>
                  <p>There followeth in the text more promiſes, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in figuratiue wordes. For he taketh a ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the dew of <hi>roſes of Libano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> and of the oliue tree: which wordes import nothing els but the great felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Iſraell, or chriſtifidelians, after that they beleue, and are receaued in the grace of God, and obtaine for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuenes of their ſinns.</p>
                  <p>Is it not an exceeding great felicitie, to obtaine for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuenes of our ſinns, to be counted righteous, before God, and to receaue the holy ghoſt, with all his gifts, and by the ſame to be healed vp in fayth: Which is the receauing of that great, pretious, and heauenly earneſt peny (that is) the ſpirite of God the father, and the ſon, which doth aſſure vs, that we be the children of God, and ſo his heyres, and coheyres with Ieſus Chriſt? what I pray you, can he want which hath the Lorde for his inheritance? This propheſy chefely taketh place in the tyme of Chriſt, when the goſpell brought forth fruite throughout the whole world, and chriſts heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kingdome was builded in euery place, that Chriſt the king of glory, be imbraſed for our God, and ſaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our through fayth, by which we are made the children of God, and ſhall prayſe him for euer, together with
<pb facs="tcp:16253:203"/>
his holy angells, to whome we ſhall be like in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world to come, in the reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the dead, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glory whereof exceedeth all that the hartes of earthly creatures can conceaue: but it is now hid. For we are as yet but bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>in hope,</hi> but when our king, the prince of glory, ſhall come in his maieſtye to iudgement, then ſhall our feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie be made manifeſt.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.24.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>To be ſhort, the Lord ſhall be the defence, bulwark, comfort, helpe, ſolace, and ſound felicitye of Iſrael.

                     <hi>Ye ſhall alſo know. that I am in the middeſt of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell, and that I am the Lord, your God, and none other, and my people, ſhall neuer be aſhamed.</hi> And afterward, as Peter cited this prophecy on whitſonday in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>at Ieruſalem, In thoſe dayes,</hi> that is, in the tyme of Meſſias. <hi>I will powre out my ſpirit vpon all fleſh.

But who ſo euer ſhall call vpon the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaued. For in mount Sion, and in Ieruſalem ſhall be deliueraunce, as the Lord hath ſayd, and in the remnant whome the Lord ſhall call.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This propheſy tooke place in Chriſts time: for Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell had then experience in deed, that god was with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in mans fleſh. And the holy ghoſt was then much more gloriouſly, royally, and abounda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the natiuitie, paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Meſſias. For before they were but few, which had the ſpirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying: but when Ieſus Chriſt, was aſcended vnto the right hand of his father, then the holy ghoſt withall his giftes was wonderfully, and richly geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as the hebrew word <hi>Eſchpoch</hi> declareth, which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth to poure out. The holy ghoſt, was viſibly pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon faythfull Chriſtians, when they were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the Church in all places had his teachers who had the ſpirite of propheſying. And the knowledge of Chriſt, is now ſpread abroad, and diſperſed throughout the whole world.</p>
                  <p>But where the prophet ſpeaketh of Sion, and Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem it muſt be vnderſtood, of the church of faythfull Chriſtians, wherein Chriſt hath his habitation, as in his owne kingdome. Who ſo euer will be ſaued from ſinne, death, and tyranny of Sathan, he muſt beleue in Chriſt, call vpon Chriſt, and be brought into the church of chriſt: for without that Church, is neither health nor forgeuenes of ſins. Neither is there any cauſe, why a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſinner, ſhould reſpect this or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citie, aboue other as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes did earthly Sion, &amp; Ieruſalem, ſeeing Ioell ſayth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, the Lord <hi>would poure out his ſpirite vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all fleſh,</hi> not only vpon the Iewes in Ieruſalem, or in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> land of Canaan, but euery where through the whole worlde where the Goſpel is beleued. It followeth therfore that whoſoeuer ſhall call vpon the name of god ſhall be ſafe, and not the Iewes onely, which ſerued, and called v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God at Ieruſalem, for then, was that time come:<note place="margin">Iohn. 4.23</note> of which Chriſt ſayth in Iohn, that the heauenly father
<pb facs="tcp:16253:204"/>
requireth true worſhippers, which worſhip, and call vpon him in ſpirit, and truth. Behold, the kingdome of Chriſt hath not any bond, or limits preſcribed to it. The gates of heauenly Ieruſalem are ſo broad, that euery one that will may eaſely enter in.</p>
                  <p>There is no need now, that any ſhould be circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſed, that is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any ſhould come to Ieruſalem, to offer vp the bloud of beaſtes. Nether is it neceſſary, that he ſhould be of the ſtock of Abraham, after the fleſh: onely let him beleue the goſpel of the power, and grace of Chriſt, and let him cal vpon Chriſt, in al places, &amp; ſo maye he haue enteraunce vnto the true Sion. This is the moſt redy, compendious, and onely way, and dore vnto Sion: where the true helth, and ſaluation, of Gods grace is found. This is the notable, and large way of deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce, not onely of the Iſraelits, according to the fleſh, but of al men beleuing, and calling vpon Chriſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they be. Thus you read in the acts when the ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the priſon in Philippa,<note place="margin">Acts. 16.30</note> aſked Paule, and Silas what he ſhould do to obtayne ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>then Paule aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: beleue in the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaued, thou, and thine houſhold:</hi> They commaund him not, to goe to the Temple in Ieruſalem, or Sion. For, the Spirituall Ieruſalem, was then begun to be ſpread abroad among the Gentiles, throughout the whol world. And whereſoeuer any beleue the goſpell, and cal vpon Chriſt, the ſame are ſaued, and are in the ſpirituall Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (that is) in the Church of the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and haue one true God, one ſauiour, one teacher, one ſpirite, one fayth, and one hope, with all the ſaints, in the world.

                  <p>He propheſyeth of Chriſt in his <hi>9.</hi> chapter, and he calleth him the Tabernacle of Dauid. Becauſe Chriſt was born of the ſtock of Dauid: and he calleth him a fallen tabernacle: for he ſpeaketh according to the opinion of the Iewes. For while the Iewes were now, and then captiues, and diſperſed, &amp; afflicted: and while the promiſe of Meſſias, which was that he ſhold come of the ſtock of Dauid, was in their opinion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and long delayd, they greatly regarded it not, but for the moſt part, deſpyſed it, as though God wold not performe it. Yea, after the captiuity of Babylon, when Chriſt his comming drew neare, and thoſe ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty weekes of yeares, which Danyell ſpeaketh of, drew towardes their end: the famely of Dauid fell in decay, and was cleane without power, and honor. So that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was neither eſteemed, nor regarded, and al men thought that Meſſias, that great king of Iſraell, could not riſe of that ſtock. For the parents of Chriſt, dwelled not in Bethelem in Iuda, in the citie of Dauid, or at
<pb facs="tcp:16253:205"/>
Ieruſalem in Sion: but in Nazareth, a citie of Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley:<note place="margin">Dauids rumous ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle reſtored by Chriſt.</note> ſo that the houſe of Dauid, and Meſſias, who was promyſed to come of Dauid, ſeemed vnto the Iewes a ruinous tabernacle quite fallen down.</p>
                  <p>When therfore it came to pas, that Chriſt was born in Bethelem, the citie of Dauid, the tabernacle of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid was reſtored: and that kingdome which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſed ſhould riſe of his ſeed, was then perfectly erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and that which before ſeemed fallen, ruinous, and deſtroyed, was then at the laſt repayred, and amended: and that promiſe which was made to Dauid, to wit, that his ſeed ſhould raign, and rule in his throne, was then mightely fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>And the <hi>Thargum</hi> ſaith, that Chriſt, &amp; his kingdome is promiſed by this tabernacle of Dauid: and doubt ye not, but that this expoſition of Ionathas is good and true. Theſe are his wordes, <hi>Akin Iath malcuta debeth</hi> Dauid, (that is,) I will raiſe vp the kingdome of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids houſe, that is the kingdome of Chriſt. But marke this, although Dauids kingdome before was mighty, ſo that he ruled not onely ouer the <hi>12.</hi> tribes of Iſraell, but alſo ouer the Idumites, Sirians, Moabites, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines, and other nations moe: yet was all that his gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but a ripe of the true Dauid Chriſt Ieſus, and his euerlaſting kingdome: nay being compared vnto Chriſtes kingdome, all his kingdome was but as decayed, broken, and ſhaken, ruinous, and torne taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle. But when Chriſt came, then was the horne or kingdome of Saluation erected in the houſe of Dauid, and that kingly throne of Dauid was then geuen to the true king. For Chriſt by the goſpell, calleth all the tribes of Iſraell, into his ſpirituall kingdome, and he called the ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles through the whole world, by his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, that both the Iewes, and Gentiles might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue this ſone of Dauid, &amp; acknowledge him for their kinge, and that he be king ouer all men, from ſea to ſea,</p>

                  <p>Saint Iames alledged this prophecy, in the firſt counſell of the Apoſtles holden at Ieruſalem, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh, and proue the Chriſtian libertye, and the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Gentiles, how they were not to be loden with Moyſes law, but that to preache the name of Chriſte, and beleue therein both emongeſt the Iewes, and Gentiles is ſufficient ſaluation, and that both Iewes, and Gentiles, as are now ſaued,<note place="margin">Chriſtian libertye.</note> not by the works of the law, but by the grace of our god in Chriſt: and that circumſicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with other workes of the law, are not needfull vnto Iuſtification. This is the Chriſtian libertye, which we haue through Meſſias the true Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, which in the new teſtament, is openly preached through the whole world: &amp; this is that time of grace, that moſt acceptable time, of which Amos propheſieth. This is the day of Saluation. Afterward he propheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in figures, that the kingdome of Chriſt ſhall be a bleſſed kingdome: and he vſeth ſuch wordes, as if he ſhould ſpeak of ſome corporal, or earthly bleſſing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in aboundeth wine, fruites, corne, and ſtately, and coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly building, pleaſaunt gardens, with all other thinges neceſſary for a pleaſaunt lyfe.<note place="margin">A generall rule.</note> But you know my ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and common rule of theſe, and ſuch lyke pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies, to wit, that they muſt be vnderſtood of Chriſt,

and his ſpirituall kingdome, that we ſet not our will of corporall thinges, as do the blinded Iewes.

But we muſt ſpeake, and thinke of Chriſtes kingdome, as Chriſt himſelfe, and the Apoſtles, deſcribe it in the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>You muſt therfore vnderſtand by theſe corporall trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and bleſſings,<note place="margin">Eph. 1.3.</note> the ſpirituall bleſſings, of which Paul ſpeaketh to the Epheſians, ſaying: That <hi>God the father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath bleſſed vs with all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall bleſsings in heauenly things in Chriſt.</hi> And he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth this bleſſing promyſed in Chriſt, the <hi>vnſearchable riches of Chriſt,</hi> which for the greatnes, and excellency therof,<note place="margin">Ephe. 3.8</note> cannot be ſearched out. But the holy Ghoſt in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcriptures, vſeth to ſpeak vnto vs of ſpiritual things by outward ſimilitudes, and thinges which are many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt vnto our eyes, as fathers vſe to forme their tonges and talke, to the capacitie, and vnderſtanding of their children. For ſo long as we are in this fleſh, we are too too blind, &amp; nothing capable of heauenly things. And it may appeare by the circumſtances, that the prophet propheſyeth not here of earthly thinges: for the Lord promyſeth, that he will turne the captiuitie of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that is, that he will deliuer his people from al their enemies.</p>
                  <p>This is that glorious, and famous deliueraunce which the people of God, that is, the faithful chriſtians, haue in Chriſt Ieſu. He promiſeth to preſerue them in their land. They had before the land of Canaan, but God will geue them, and their heires, a far better land, wherin ſhall be aboundance of all bleſſings, and all fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity.

                  <p>This expoſition is erroneous, and falſe: for the lord made no ſuch promiſe with them as they dreame.

                  <p>This promiſe will neuer deceaue vs. For the Lord ſware vnto vs, by a holy, and faythfull oth, that ſo the rather he might confirme vs in fayth, and make vs the leſſe doubt, that all thoſe thinges ſhould come to paſſe, which he had promiſed: and that for Meſſias his ſake, he would helpe vs, be gratious vnto vs, and deliuer vs from all our calamities.

                  <p>S. Paule in his epiſtles to the Rom.

                  <p>Now note that the kingdome of Chriſt,<note place="margin">The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifidelians or Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faythfull.</note> is not an earthly, but a ſpirituall kingdome, and that the true chriſtifidelians, are not proudly prickt vp in the pomp of worldly vanitie, neither doth the world greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard them, and yet are they in great price, and highly glorified with God.</p>
                  <p>He calleth faythfull Chriſtians a miſerable, and pore people.

Gods word, they truſt him, who hath promiſed them true, and euerlaſting lyfe, with ſure, parfite, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall treaſures. He calleth faythfull Chriſtians, as other prophets do, <hi>reliques,</hi> or remnantes: for the ſmaleſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>It followeth therefore, that the remnant of Iſraell, the faythfull Chriſtians, ſhall liue ſafely, and without daunger.

                  <p>What then neede they feare? haue they not I pray you in him, (and of him,) a true ſhepheard, comforter, ſauiour, deliuerer, and a full horne of all happines.</p>

For the prophet vſeth that great name Iehoua, that is God himſelfe: (<hi>3.</hi> perſons, and one God.)</p>
                  <p>Is not this kingdome of Chriſt, a glorious, and princely kingdome? are not theſe treaſures (which our faythfull God promiſeth by his Prophets in Chriſt) great, vnſpeakeable, and infinite treaſures?

                  <p>Wherfore, Sophoni ſayth furthermore, <hi>at that time</hi> that is in the day of ſaluation, when Chriſt ſhall come, then ſhall a ioyfull Meſſage be brought vnto Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the church, as the <hi>Angell ſayd vnto the ſheapherds,</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:16253:218"/>
that he doth reioyce in thee, euen as the tender father doth in his deerely beloued ſon, when he loueth, and cheriſheth him.</p>
                  <p>The prophet cannot ſufficiently declare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ioy which god taketh in the congregation of the faythful Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, ſaying: <hi>he will ſaue thee: and he will reioyce ouer thee in great gladnes,</hi> that is, he will poure forth all his faythfulnes vpon thee, and his fatherly good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee, that at the laſt the world may be compelled to ſee and palpably feele (but eſpecially the children of God ſhall know) that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord loueth thee aboundantly as Paul writeth to Titus.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Titus. 3 6.</note>And he promiſeth Chriſtian liberty, becauſe he will take away theſe toyes, to wit the lyfe, and tradition of men: we knowe the pharaſies taught the law naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely, and went a horing with the doctrine of men teaching, that men ſhould do the workes of the law, to the end that they ſhould be iuſtified, and haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes, by the workes of the law, and not by the mere grace of God, and Chriſt alone.</p>
                  <p>And he promiſeth the Church ſuch a helpe, as by which, her enemies ſhould be deſtroyed, but ſhe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new ſtill.

For he prophecied after the captiuitie of Babilon, and he moueth the people, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to build vp the temple agayine, that the worſhip of God might be reſtored.

                  </p>
                  <p>This prophecy foreſpeaketh of the former comming of Meſſias into the world, how he ſhould come to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem into the temple, and how there ſhould be a great change, both in heauen, and earth. For the Lord hath ſent the Angell of the great counſell, euen his ſon in the fleſh: that by Chriſt, he might ſummarily reſtore all thinges, in heauen and earth: wherefore it was of neceſſitie to follow, that Iudaiſme ſhould be abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that the Iewes ſhould reuolt, and that the ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, ſhould be made the people of God: and that great wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders ſhould be don, at which euen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Angels ſhould maruell for euer.</p>
                  <p>And he ſayth that Chriſt is the hope of all nations. For all men are borne ſinners, and ſinn dayly, but he which ſinneth,<note place="margin">We are by nature ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> doth the worke of the deuill, and is the ſeruaunt of Sathan, and child of death. From the which kingdome of ſin, death, and damnation, no man can o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe be deliuered,<note place="margin">Our ſtate without Chriſt.</note> but by Meſſias, who onely was ſent of God, to take away the workes of the deuill, and deſtroy the kingdome of Sathan, to wit, ſin, and death, and to geue vs true life. And therefore he is the hope of the whole world: neither is there any comfort, helpe, forgeuenes of ſinnes, righteouſnes, peace, ſafety, ioy, lyfe, or health, any where els to be found, but onely in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Therefore all the elect, euen from the beginning, haue very carefully, and earneſtly deſired Chriſt, becauſe no man either could, or ought, to helpe the wretched world or deliuer it, from euerlaſting miſery, and calamity, and bring it to euerlaſting ioy, but only Ieſus Chriſt. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt, in the laſt week of Daniel, came into this world then came our true preacher, our onely reconciler, and mediator, who made, and confirmed the euerlaſting co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, of peace, betwen God, and vs. And the prophet repeateth this word,<note place="margin">The Lord named fiue times.</note>

And ſo we haue Chriſt, the comfort of all nations, of all ſinners, &amp; the true peace of the whole world, and that in the temple, (that is,) in the Churche of Chriſt, who him ſelfe, is our <hi>peace,</hi> as Paule ſayth.<note place="margin">Ephe. 2.24.</note> And ſeeing Chriſt is the comfort of all nations, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that both they ought to beleue, &amp; truſt in him, and that his kingdome alſo ſhould be among all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, both Iewes, &amp; gentiles through the whole world.</p>
                  <p>And therefore ſhal they hope to haue, &amp; alſo ſurely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue of him forgeuenes of their ſinnes, righteouſnes, reconciliation with God, true peace, ſecuritye, euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting ioy, true life, and eternall ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For if the ſin of the Gentiles ſhould not be taken away, then in deede ſhould neither death, nor Sathans tyranny, and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome be taken away, neither could they haue any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

the dayes wherein he liued, required the ſame. For he prophecied, when the Iewes were euen at the point of returning out of the captiuitie of Babilon, and when the Citie with the temple, ſhould be builded agayne. The people at that time, were yet faint harted, feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and doubted that they ſhould not be ſafe from their enemies: and therfore he comforteth them, and ſetteth Chriſt before their eyes, as a louing Sauiour, that ſo they might be of good cheare, ſaying: that Chriſt ſhould ſpedely come and helpe his ſeruantes, and ſpread his kingdome through the whole world: and therfore was it needefull, that Iuda, and Ieruſalem ſhould be buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againe, to the end, they might receaue their owne king. And the prophet ſpeaketh, as followeth. <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem ſhall be inhabited without the walles: for the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of men,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zach. 3.4.</note> 
                     <hi>and cattell therein. For I (ſayth the Lord) will be vnto her, a wall of fire round about, and will be the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the mideſt of her.</hi> Here he propheſieth of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Ieruſalem, to wit, the church of Chriſt for the earthly Ieruſalem had hir boundes, and walles, but the heauenly Ieruſalem, ſhal be ſo wide, and large, that it can not be compaſſed with any walles, yea it ſhall be as wide as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world. For it is the kingdome of Chriſt, which by little, and little, without ceaſing, ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, vnto the laſt day: and the true children of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham are (as the God of Abraham promiſed,) euen as the ſand of the ſea, and the ſtarre in the firmament: and the promiſed bleſſing ſhall come vpon all nations through the whole world, that Chriſt maye be knowen and worſhipped, euery where, for the true Lord &amp; god.</p>
                  <p>By the cattell, vnderſtand weakelinges, and ſuch as are ignoraunt in the knowledge of the ſcriptures, and fayth: theſe are led, and fed, in the paſtures of Chriſt, by thoſe which are more ſtrong, and firme in fayth.</p>

                  <p>You ſee that he ſpeaketh here, of the heauenly Citye

wherein God himſelfe, will be the watchman, keper, wall, &amp; defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, if their God be thus preſent with vs, we haue iuſt cauſe to reioyce in the Lord: ſeeing, that whereſoeuer God himſelfe watcheth, defendeth, and fighteth for vs, there are we ſafe, out of daunger of this world, and Sathan, and neede not feare them. To be breefe, the great humilititie of Chriſt Ieſus, in that he vouchſafed to become man, being the true ſon of God: and the ſending of the holy ghoſt, the true teacher of holſome doctrine, in the Church of God, whereby the church is ſtill houlden, and preſerued in truth, that it may ſtedfaſtly cleaue to God: where as otherwiſe, the whole world is blinded with errors, caried away with lyes, and miſerably deceaueth it ſelfe: theſe I ſay do ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly declare, how gloriouſly the Lord hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelfe in this ſpirituall Ieruſalem. Sathan, the world, and heretickes, do not ceaſe, nor ſleepe: but bend themſelues, in all they may, yea, they ſtriue with hand, and foote, to deſtroy Chriſt his church. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, according to the fleſh, it be weake, yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe it ſtandeth, and getteth the victory ouer all hir enemies. So plentifully, doth the Lord declare his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in his ſpirituall citye the Church.</p>
                  <p>In the wordes following, he ſetteth forth the helpe, and comfort, which we ſhall haue in Chriſt his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſaying: <hi>He which toucheth you,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>A little after, Zachary comforteth ſuch Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as are vnder the croſſe, and by reaſon of the weakenes of the fleſh, are in feare, and trouble, euen as the Iewes were at that time ſaying: <hi>Reioyce, and be glad, O daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sion: for I come, and will dwell in the middeſt of thee ſayth the Lord: and many nations, ſhall be ioyned to the Lord, in that day, and ſhall be my people, and I will dwell
<pb facs="tcp:16253:221"/>
in the middeſt of thee, and thou ſhalt know the Lord of hoſtes hath ſent me vnto the. And the Lord ſhall inherit Iuda, his portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the holy land, and ſhall chuſe Ieruſalem agayne. Let all fleſh be ſtill before the Lord, for he is raiſed vp out of his holy place.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is to ſay, O Sion, although thou be afflicted here in the earth, yet be of good chere, becauſe thou ſhalt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinew. For I my ſelfe do come, and abide with thee. Was not this fulfilled, when god became man? and at this day, whereſoeuer Gods word is receaued, there doth God dwell, and that is the true Sion, as Chriſt ſayth in Iohn: He that loueth mee, keepeth my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes,<note place="margin">Iohn. 14.23</note> and my Father will loue him, and we will come vnto him, and will dwell with him.</p>
                  <p>Surely this is the ſpirituall kingdome, wherein god dwelleth with vs by the goſpel, and by fayth which the holy ghoſt worketh in vs: as S. Paul ſayth to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe. Chriſt dwelleth in our hartes by fayth. And E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay telleth vs where God dwelleth, to wit, in faythfull and humble hartes,<note place="margin">Eſay. 66.2</note> indewed with the feare of God, and not in earthly temples mad with handes.</p>
                  <p>Zachary alſo telleth vs, that the kingdome of Chriſt ſhall be large, and wide, and that the gentils, ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Chriſtifidelians: and ſo by fayth in Chriſt ſhal al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo become the people of God.</p>
                  <p>All theſe thinges are dayly fulfilled, that we by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience may know theſe thinges to be moſt true, which they haue prophecied: and thy are ſure, by great miracles, but no man doth earneſtly, and diligently conſider them, as in deede they ought to do, if they will be accounted true Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>But how ſhall Iuda be the inheritaunce of God? and Ieruſalem choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againe? Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then when the Lord ſhall caſt downe the partitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wall betwixt the Iewes, and Gentiles, and by the Goſpell make of two peoples one holy nation, then I ſay, ſhall the true Iuda, that is, the congregation of ſuch as confeſſe the Lord, be made Gods inheritaunce, one Ieruſalem, and one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected citie: but this ſhall not be onely in Canaan, but through all the whole world. Afterward followeth an exhortation vnto the whole world, where he ſayth, <hi>let
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:16253:221"/>
all fleſh be ſtill, or ſilent.</hi> Here we may learne,<note place="margin">Let all fleſh be ſtill.</note> that he ſpeaketh in this place of ſpirituall Iuda, and Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which appertaineth to the whole world: otherwiſe he would haue commaunded onely the Iewes alone to haue bin ſtill, and ſilent, if the Iewes alone, and none els, ſhould haue bin his kingdome.</p>
                  <p>This therfore is the ſence: God wil dwell both with the Iewes, &amp; Gentils, in all places through the whole world. Wherfore let all the earth be ſilent, let euery man ſuffer the Lord to worke, raygn, and haue power in him: he will do all thinges well, and wiſely: let no man be wiſe in his owne conceite, let no man brag of his owne holines, let no man attribute any thing vnto himfelfe, but let all men humble, and ſubmit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. For here is now wrought a ſtrange thing: when the Lord commeth, and ruleth men, when God commeth, let all fleſh be ſilent, and acknowledge themſelues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned ſinners, and then will the Lord deliuer them: for how ſhall ſin, or miſerye haue any abiding there where the Lord is king, and gouerner.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>3.</hi> Chapiter, he ſayth.<note place="margin">Zacha. 3.8.</note> 
                     <hi>Here now O Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſua, the hye prieſt, thou and thy fellowes, that ſit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee: for they are monſterous perſons. But behold, I will bring forth the branche, my ſeruant: for loe the ſtone that I haue layed before Iehoſua, vpon one ſtone ſhall be 7. eyes, behold I wil cut out the grauing therof ſayth the Lord of hoſtes, and I will take away the iniquitie of this land, in one day: in that day, ſayth the Lord of hoſtes, ſhall ye call euery man his neighbour, vnder the vine, and vnder the figge tree.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The prophet ſpeaketh plainely here of Chriſt, of his paſſion, and of his kingdome. Firſt the Lorde talketh with the hye prieſt Iehoſua, who was a figure of chriſt and therefore hath the ſame name, and is called Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſua, or Ieſus, as the <hi>70.</hi> interpretors call him here in their tranſlation. And wheras he ſpeaketh onely to the hye prieſt, and his frendes, he teacheth vs that the promiſes of Chriſt, and his kingdome ſhall not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit all men, and that euery man ſhall not be partaker therof. And the cauſe is onely, for that all do not beleue in Chriſt: for that promiſe belongeth onely to the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb facs="tcp:16253:222"/>
Chriſtians, who together with Iehoſua, hath all one fayth, and ſpirite, and he calleth them, <hi>monſterous perſons,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A great maruell.</note> or great marueils. For there is no more mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous thinge in the world, then a godly man, who will leaue all thinges in this earth, and follow Chriſt looking for forgeuenes of ſinnes, and euerlaſting lyfe, onely by him, and by nothing els.</p>
                  <p>The world wondereth, that faythfull Chriſtians can ſo diſpiſe (euen in this life) this world with all the ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures thereof, for Chriſtes ſake: who himſelfe diſpiſed all the honor of this world, and vtterly reiected y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pomp and vaine glory therof. And for this cauſe, Chriſtians in this world, are counted fooles. Behold, I pray you how, euen Cleophas, and his companion at the firſt were offended at Chriſt, although they were his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.32</note> Therefore ſayth Paule very well. <hi>Chriſt is vnto the Iewes a ſtumbling block, and vnto the Gretians, or Gè<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles fooliſhnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Furthermore God doth <hi>promiſe his ſeruant Chriſt.</hi> Chriſt in the ſcriptures, is often called the ſeruaunt of god, for his ſeruice, which here he hath don in the earth (to wit,) becauſe he taught his flock, becauſe he ſuffered for ſinners, and becauſe he was obedient vnto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in fulfilling his commaundement, euen to death, the death of the croſſe: of which his worke, and ſeruice wrought for vs, all theſe other ſeruauntes of god haue prophecied, but none of them all either ought, or could do, and execute that office.</p>
                  <p>But he calleth Chriſt <hi>Zemah,</hi> that is, a braunch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth dayly floriſh, and grow hier, and hier, as a young ſpire, or young braunche. Chriſt is alſo ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their places, by the ſame name, as in the <hi>13.</hi> of Hieri. the <hi>4.</hi> of Eſay, &amp;c. For lyke as the bud groweth vntill it commeth vnto the naturall length, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: euen ſo doth Chriſt increaſe, and grow by the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, in the hartes of men. And looke how much longer and further he is knowen, and preached, ſo much more plainly is he knowen, and preached: The kingdome of Chriſt waxeth dayly greater, and greater, and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, euen vnto the laſt day, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all the elect may be borne, called, and iuſtified.</p>

                  <p>They therfore which imbrace the goſpell by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghoſt, that they may beleue in Chriſt, and know the vnſearchable riches of his grace, and bring others to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledge therof, they are the <hi>7.</hi> eyes.

what the ſpirite is, and what life, righteouſnes, ſin, hel, and Angels be: and what the deuill, the world, the lyfe preſent, and the lyfe to come be. Of all which the wiſe of the world can not ſo well iudge, as the blind man doth of colors.</p>
                  <p>And where he ſayth, that <hi>he will cut out the grauing of that ſtone,</hi> that is meant, of the paſſion of Chriſt: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that by his croſſe, and paſſion, he was as it were polliſhed, &amp; grauen, that he might be the corner ſtone of the church: he was alſo formed, and polliſhed to his glory, euen as a ſtone is cut, and polliſhed for the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as he himſelfe alſo ſayth vnto theſe. <hi>2.</hi> his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.

                  <p>As if he ſhould ſay, in the leuiticall prieſthood were diuers ſacrifices for ſin, but thoſe ſacrifices could not in deed take away any ſin, by their bloud, they weare on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly figures betokening Meſſias to come, he only alone both can, &amp; muſt by his ingrauing, &amp; death in one day, (that is to ſay,) on good friday, offer vp ſuch a ſacrifice, and make ſuch a reconciliation for ſin, as may be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for all the ſins, which haue ben committed from the beginning of the world, and ſhall be vnto the end thereof.</p>
                  <p>Hereby alſo you may gather his reſurrection. For if he muſt be cut of, (that is) put to death, and ſo take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all ſin, and conſequently aboliſh death it ſelfe, it muſt needes, that he muſt riſe agayne, and raiſe vs vp

For he putteth the crown onely vpon the head of him, that was then the hye prieſt, but he did not put it vpon the leuitical magiſtrate Zerubabell. And againe he calleth Meſſias <hi>Zemath,</hi> &amp; he ſheweth the cauſe, why he calleth him ſo. For this king, and prieſt, ſhall haue ſo great felicitie, and proſperitie in his kingdome,<note place="margin">Eſa. 53.10.</note> that all thinges ſhall haue proſperous ſucceſſe, and ſhall fall forth happely, and according to his minde, and deſire. And Eſay ſayth. <hi>The will of the Lord, ſhall proſper in the

hande of Meſſias.</hi> As a fine bow, or braunch, at the firſt is ſmall, and tender, but after groweth hyer, and hyer, and doth ſhute forth, vntill at the laſt, it become a faire, pleaſant, and hye tree, full of faire, and bewtifull braun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſo that it delighteth the eyes of all men, and is alſo very pleaſaunt, by reaſon of the ſhadowe therof: euen ſo Chriſt although he was in the beginning but ſmall and vnknowen, (when his name was yet but onely knowen in Iudea, in the land of Iſraell, and was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt part of men,) yet did he grow ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely, and ſhute vp ſo hy, and ſpread ſo broad y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he filleth the whole world, with his bowes, and braunches, as Eſay ſayth,<note place="margin">Eſay. 9.3.</note> that he may confirme, and ſtrengthen it &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And Daniell ſayth, that the ſtone which is taken out of the mountaine without handes, becommeth a great mountaine, and filleth the whole earth. This <hi>Zemah,</hi> is not tied vnto a certaine place, where he ſhould be king as Dauid was vnto Ieruſalem: but he is king in al the world, and raygneth in all places, by the goſpel &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoſt. Sathan with this his world goeth about to hinder, deſtroy, cut downe, and pluck vp bloſſomes, while it be young, that it grow not: but the more they hinder it, the better it proſpereth, and groweth, and buildeth Gods temple,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.5.</note> (that is,) the church of Chriſt, with pretious, and <hi>liuely ſtones,</hi> of which Peter ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth. But this is a far greater temple, then that which. Iehoſchua, and Zerubabell builded at Ieruſalem. It is a temple which no Nebucadnezer, no Antiochus, nor Tytus can burne, and deſtroy. This temple is the ſpirituall temple of the Lorde, builded by the goſpell through the whole world, and conſecrated by the holy ſpirite. This te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple ſhall ſtand for euer, againſt the gates of hell. The prieſt of this temple is an euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting prieſt, and therefore the temple muſt needes be euerlaſting. This prieſt hath thoſe true ornamentes, prayſes, and honor, which were ſignified by Arons or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. And this prieſt raigneth ſtil in his throne, and hath both the functions, to wit, the euerlaſting prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and the eternal kingdome. But note that he ſayth <hi>vpon his ſeate,</hi> by which wordes, he ſignifieth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this prieſt, is the true prieſt, &amp; king: &amp; that all other tipicall
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:16253:224"/>
prieſts, and kinges were but ſeruauntes, or miniſters to this prieſt, and that they in ther miniſterie, did but onely ſeruice vnto this true king, and prieſt. But Chriſt the true bloſſome of Dauid, is the true king, and prieſt, and the true, and naturall Lord of the throne, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall kingdome. He only ſhall beare rule in this throne. This eternall throne is onely his ſeate, and ſhall ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for euer. Neither ſhall there euer hereafter be any contention, or diſſentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, betwene theſe two kingdomes (to wit) the ſpirituall prieſthood, and kingdome: as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore times there hath ben betwene the externall prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, and terreſtriall kingdome. For theſe two func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are both now turned to one perſon, which both can make interceſſion for vs, in heauen, before the father, as our prieſt, and defend, and gouerne vs here in earth, as an omnipotent king. Ionathan the Caldean confirmeth this expoſition, who hath tranſlated this text of <hi>Zach.</hi> thus in the caldean tongue. Behold for here is the man, whoſe name is <hi>Moſchiah,</hi> which ſhall come to be made manifeſt, famous, and glorious. And he himſelfe ſhall build the temple of the Lord. But you may not heare vnderſtand an earthly temple. For like as the prieſt is ſpiriturall, ſo doth he build vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord a ſpirituall temple, wherein he himſelfe alone doth exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the function, both of the prieſt, and king.</p>
                  <p>Zach in his <hi>8.</hi> chap. prophecieth, that the kingdome of Chriſt ſhall be very ample, and glorious in all the world. And that not the Iewes alone ſhould reape profite by Meſſias, but that the Gentiles alſo ſhall be ioyned vnto the Iewes, and acknowledge,<note place="margin">Zach. 8.20.</note> and call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Chriſt their Lord: his wordes be theſe. <hi>Thus ſayth the Lord of hoſtes, that there ſhall yet come people, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitantes of great cities, and they that dwell in one citie, ſhall go vnto an other, ſaying: vp let vs go, and pray before the Lord, and ſeeke the Lord of hoſtes. I will goe alſo, yea great people, and mighty nations ſhall come to ſeeke the Lord of hoſtes in Ieruſalem, and to pray before the Lord. Thus ſayth the Lord of hoſtes: in thoſe dayes ſhall ten men take hould out of all languages of the nations, euen take hould of the ſkirt of him that is a Iew, and ſay, we will goe with you: for we haue heard, that God is with you.</hi>

                  <p>Here you heare agayne, what kind of kingdome Chriſtes kingdom is: to wit, a kingdome which is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſtand vpon watch, and be ready in armure. For, it hath againſt it moſt mighty enemies: it muſt therfore be of ſome power, &amp; ſtrength, nay of very great ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth if it ſhal conquere ſo great enemies. But that can not be by any corporall, or worldly meanes, but ſpiritually by faith, as the prophets words doe plainly import, and ſignifie. But ſuch, and ſo great is the obſtinate blindnes of the Iewes, that they dreame that the prophets ſpeak of an earthly kingdome of Chriſt here in this world, which ſhal vſe corporall armour, and ſtrength, and haue worldly pompe, and glory.</p>
                  <p>Although therfore the godly be ſore troubled with very many enemies, yet for all that, ſhall they be, and remayne without danger,<note place="margin">the patience of the godly.</note> but through patience, ſo that they ſuffer, and take al things wel, and patiently, which come vpon them.</p>
                  <p>The prophet alſo deſcribeth the ſpirituall weapons wherewithall Chriſt armeth, and defendeth the godly in his kingdome, ſaying, <hi>I will poure, ſaith he, my ſpirite of grace,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zach. 10.10</note> 
                     <hi>and prayer, or compaſſion, vpon the houſe of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid.</hi> That is, I will geue my holy ſpirite vnto my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, that it may lighten them with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true knowledge of the goſpel, that they may know that I am mercifull vnto them for Chriſt his ſake,<note place="margin">the armure of the godly.</note> and that I doe pardon their offences, wherupon they may haue quiet, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed conſciences.</p>
                  <p>Beſides this, when the ſtormes of afflictions doe come vpon them, and ſore, and vehemently vexe their fleſh, then ſhal the holy ghoſt teach them rightly to pray in the name of Ieſus Chriſt, who himſelfe doth pray for the godly with ſighes which are not able to be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:16253:228"/>
And theſe are the weapons wherewithall the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the godly doe ouercome when the cros is at hand, and tribulation hangeth ouer their heads. The godly ſtraight way fly to the name of the Lord, and call vpon it, and receaue help in due time: but our Iewes, and Anabaptiſts (when perſecution commeth) reſiſt their enemies with force, and armes, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, will they boaſt themſelues to be the people of God, which is the cauſe that they are alwayes ſo miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably confounded.</p>
                  <p>Now the prophet telleth what it was that purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the holy ghoſt for the godly: to wit, the paſſion, and death of Chriſt, <hi>They ſhall ſee,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zac. 12.10.</note> 
                     <hi>and looke vpon me (ſayth the Lord) whom they haue pearced.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here God ſpeaketh in his own perſon, who before ſpake in the prophets perſon, and confeſſeth that he is pearced, that is, nayled vpon the cros, and wounded. And it is here proued by this text, that Chriſt is true God, and man, who ſhould ſuffer, and die for vs. And it followeth alſo, that Chriſt, with all Chriſtifidelians, ſhall riſe again. For he had promyſed before, that he wold geue his holy ſpirite vnto the godly, that he wold deſtroy the enemies of the godly, and that he would pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſerue, and defend the godly. If, therfore, he muſt keepe, and preſerue his elect for euer, and duely puniſh all the gentils, and their enemies, it muſt needes follow that he muſt riſe from death, and rayſe vp his ſeruants,<note place="margin">God and man one per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon.</note> and gouern the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for euer. And here obſerue this, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God, and man, Chriſt, is one perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for he ſaith, <hi>they ſhal loke vpon me whom they haue pearced.</hi> Chriſt was pearced accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his manhode, and not according to his Godhed alone. He ſpeaketh plainly of one perſon alone. He ſaith <hi>me,</hi> and deuideth not his Godhead from his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hode. For he him ſelfe, the euerlaſting ſonne of God, was pearced, but according to his humanity, not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his great, and infinite deity, as Paul ſayth to Cor. The Iewes <hi>crucified the Lord of glory.</hi> That is,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.8.</note> the God of <hi>Zeboth.</hi> Pſal. <hi>25.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus, Chriſt by the goſpel is preached, and ſeen how he was crucified. But at the laſt day ſhall his true humain nature, wherin he was crucified, and wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, in deed be ſeen. He kept the print of his wounds in his

But eſpecially, and properly the godly mourn when by faith they apprehend, and deeply ponder the paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and death of Chriſt, when they imitate Chriſt in ſuffering, and when euery one beareth his own cros, and ſuffreth with Chriſt,<note place="margin">How Chriſt is lamented for.</note> to the mortification of the old man.</p>
                  <p>And Zachery in chap. <hi>13.</hi> propheſyeth of the fruites, of Chriſtes paſſion, of the forgeuenes of ſinnes, of the holy ghoſt, of baptiſme in the houſe of Dauid, and of the church which ſhould be: ſaying, <hi>in that day there ſhall be a fountayn opened to the houſe of Dauid: and to the inhabitants of Ieruſalem,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Tit. 3.5</note> And this holy fountain ſtandeth alway open in the houſe of Dauid, that all men may come, &amp; drinke.

There were in the old teſtament many waſhings, and cleanſings, but none could be deliuered by them from, ſinne: but this ſpring of the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hallowed by the precious bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, floweth alwayes full of meer grace: and this welſpring cleanſeth, and drowneth all the filthynes, and vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes of all ſinnes.

                  <p>And Zachary propheſyeth again a litle after, of the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:16253:229"/>
paſſion of Ieſus Chriſt our true ſhepheard ſaying: <hi>Ariſe O ſword vpon my ſhepheard, and the man, that is, my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaith the Lord of hoſtes, ſmite the ſhepheard,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zach. 13.7</note> 
                     <hi>and the ſheep ſhalbe ſcattered, and I will turne my hand vpon the litle ones. And in all the land, ſaith the Lord, two parts therein ſhall be cut of, and dye, but the third part ſhall be left ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And I will bring that third part through the fire, and wil fine them, as the ſiluer is fined, and wil try them as gold is tryed. They ſhall call on my name, and I wil heare them. I will ſay it is my people, and they ſhall ſay, the Lord is my God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ſword at that time, was the power of darck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. For, Pilate, and the hard harted Iewes, bare the ſword, and authority at that time in the earth, but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, they could not haue hurt Chriſt, vnleſſe God had ſuffered them, and ordayned the ſame before, as Chriſt ſaith, Pilat had his power from aboue. This <hi>ſhepheard</hi> is Chriſt, the <hi>ſheep</hi> are the Apoſtles, which fled when Chriſt was taken, and ſuffered.

                  </p>
                  <p>Furthermore, the Lord calleth Chriſt <hi>the man,</hi> that is, his fellow. For Chriſt is the true, and onely ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard in the church, and is alſo with the father for euer,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1.18</note> as Iohn ſaith, <hi>The ſonne is in the boſome of his father.</hi> Marke alſo, how the kingdome of this world hath no beauty, but appeareth oftentimes miſerable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can it in no wiſe be earthly, and of this world. The ſhepheard him ſelfe was ſmitten by the earthly magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, and his ſheep were terrified, and diſparſed: and the diſciples them ſelues were offended in Chriſt, as you haue heard in Cleophas, and his companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They ſuppoſed that he would haue ſmitten others, and that he would haue deliuered the Iewes from all tiranny of the gentils, neither did they yet ſee, how that they ſhould in Meſſias haue a ſpirituall deliuerance from their ſinnes, and death. But thoſe litle ones, vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt turned him ſelfe, are the afflicted, and poore chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, which are diſpyſed in this world, but deerely beloued children before God.</p>

                  <p>Two parts is that great multitude of the vngodly in the earth, which are offended in Chriſt, of which, one part cannot abide the cros, and tribulation, but turneth back vnto the world, and ſtifly cleaueth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.

                  <p>Theſe are thoſe true Chriſtians, who only doe obtain ſaluation, becauſe they abyde in the true fayth euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end, and ſuffer not them ſelues by any meanes to be called or drawne from Chriſt. Their fayth is tryed in tribulation, by which they cal vpon the name of god, in ſpirit, and truth without hipocriſy, and alwaies glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God, and are hard of God. God acknowledgeth them for his dearly beloued ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes, and they alſo confes god to be their moſt louing father.

Before that time there were many fayned Gods, but in the day of Meſſias, ſhall the only true God alone be called vpon in Chriſt. <hi>And who ſo will not come vp of all the families of the earth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zac. 14.17.</note>

For they which are not in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church of Chriſt, haue neither the word of god,

                  <p>And leaſt any man ſhould thinke, that the kingdome of Chriſt, ſhould be an earthly kingdome throughout all the world, Zach. ſayth, that in the heauenly Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, of the Church of Chriſt, the <hi>feaſt of tabernacle</hi> ſhall alwayes be celebrated.

                  <p>Note that Malla. ſayth, that the Lord (that is) Chriſt ſhall come to his temple <hi>Pithom,</hi> that is, by and by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loked for. For when the people came on heapes, and flocked vnto Iohn where he preached, ſodainely Chriſt came, and commaunded Iohn to baptiſe him, and began to teach, and went in to the temple at Ieruſalem. And Mala.<note place="margin">Mal. 3.1.</note> ſayth <hi>whome ſeeke you?</hi> for Chriſt was in the law, and prophets promiſed, as the true deliuerer of Iſraell. And therfore all the godly, gredely, &amp; earneſtly looked for him. And Malla. calleth Chriſt the Angell of the new teſtament, or couenaunt. For he was ſent from the father, as the meſſenger of the great meſſage, that he might be the mediator of the new teſtament, or of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall couenaunt of grace, which was made, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the precious bloud, and death of Chriſt. Yf this meſſenger had not ben ſent, and ſtroken this coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt of grace, betwixt God the Father and vs, and if he had not reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciled vs, and in his owne perſon wiped away our ſinnes, we had taried, and periſhed, in our ſinnes, in death, and in the wrath of God for euer.</p>
                  <p>But ſeeing that Chriſt is come, and hath made and confirmed this teſtament, or league, by ſo great a price, wee which beleue in Chriſt, haue in Chriſt the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the new teſtament, remiſſion of our ſinnes, euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting righteouſnes, reconciliation with God, and lyfe, and ſaluation. He which firſt promiſed this teſtament, is god the truth it ſelfe he which confirmed, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it, is the naturall ſon of god, our ſauiour, in whom the father is well pleaſed: and he which teacheth vs to vnderſtand this couenaunt, and to beleue it, (who alſo witneſſeth vnto vs, that the couenaunt is firme, and ſtable, and that we are the children of God,) is the holy Ghoſt. Loe theſe are the vnſearchable riches of Chriſt, which Paule euery where did magnifically preach. And therefore very well ſayth the prophet <hi>Eſcher athem hephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zim,</hi> that is, whome doe you ſo carefully, greedely, and hartely deſires. You know that <hi>Hopheptz</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy toung
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:16253:232"/>
doth ſignifie, to be rauiſhed with a ſingular, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty deſire of any thing, as when we couet to haue any thing, with a harty deſire, with a good will, and with a great and arde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t appetite. And thus did the true Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, with all their hartes, earneſtly looke for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt, becauſe they knew, that we through Chriſtes merits onely, ſhould obtaine all true felicitye with God, that is, full deliueraunce fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all euils. They did know that, which the new teſtament euery where now witneſſeth, to wit, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man of himſelfe without the ſpirite, power, &amp; hope of Meſſias could not performe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law, and that none could obtaine righteouſnes, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, but by Chriſt. And therefore did they looke for him, as the onely reconciler, and Sauiour, and as that true, and onely fulfiller of all thinges, or as Paule cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him, the fulfilling of the law, in whome they put all their confidence. For whereſoeuer they deſire, &amp; preach the mercy, and deliueraunce of God, there alſo do they deſire, and glorify Chriſt, who onely, and no other in the whole world, hath obtained, and deſerued the mercye of God, and hath brought vs true, and euerlaſting rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                  <p>He ſpeaketh of his former comming, which although vnto the true Iſraelites, and children of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, it was a ſingular comfort, and great ioy, and a thing eſpecially deſired, (as appeareth in Simeon, and Anna, the prophets, and ſuch lyke,) yet was it a horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and feareful comming, to the reſt of the vnbeleuing Iewes, Phariſes, Saduces, &amp; other deceauers, of which they did reape no ioy, or profite, but were offended in Chriſt, &amp; could not ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in his ſight. Their doctrine had daiſeled the eyes of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſort, with a great ſhew of holynes: whereas it was nothing els in deed, but hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible errors, hipocriſye, and deceite. When Chriſt Ieſus
<pb facs="tcp:16253:233"/>
came, (the true light of the world, and the truth it ſelfe, by whome came grace, and truth) then all the errors, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulations, and deceites, craftes, and hipocriſie of thoſe deceiuers, were manifeſted, and they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For he did openly reproue, and accuſe their lyfe and doctrine, and he ſo confounded them, which before were accounted moſt godly, and learned in Iudaiſme, that it might eaſely appeare vnto all men, that they were blind guids of the blinde, and meere deceiuers.</p>
                  <p>For when the goſpell was mightely, &amp; truely taught then could no error, or hipocriſie, lurke, and be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen: ſo forceable was the truth. Nay the word is ſo pure, and perfect, that euen the moſt holy are accuſed by it: becauſe no man in this fleſh, is free from ſin. To be ſhort, for this cauſe was Chriſt borne, and for this cauſe came he into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world,<note place="margin">Iohn 18.31</note> that he ſhould bere witnes vnto the truth, and he that is of truth heareth his voyce.</p>
                  <p>Sathan had ſowen, and ſpread marueilous hipocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and lyes in the world, but Chriſt came, that he might confound the lyes, and teach the truth. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his firſt comming of Chriſt (becauſe his doctrine was vnpleaſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and ſharpe vnto the world, and becauſe he accuſed them of ſin) was as a fier, which purifieth, and clenſeth all filth, and droſſe from gould, &amp; maketh a ſtrange ſeperatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the euill from the good. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he tea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cheth, he doth ſeperate gould, and ſiluer, that is, good men from copper, and droſſe, to wit, from the hard harted hipocrites. For he which was of God, heard the word of Chriſt, and left all his errors, and caſt all his hipocriſie a ſide, and became a faythfull, or true Iſraelite in whome was no deceite. By the croſſe alſo they were purged, and tryed, as gould in the fier. This tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and croſſe, alway waiteth vpon the word, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes commeth with the word.</p>
                  <p>And Chriſt, at his firſt comming, hath true Leuites, &amp; ſpirituall prieſtes,<note place="margin">Pe. 2.9.10.</note> which are conſecrated, and clenſed. Theſe are, as Peter ſayth, all that truly beleue in chriſt, but eſpecially,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.28. Gala. 3.11.</note> they which faythfully teach the word, by which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> righteouſnes of fayth, doth enter into the hart.

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:16253:233"/>
They offer themſelues in fayth, they offer an humble, and penitent hart, and they offer prayſes, and thankeſgeuing, for their redemption in Chriſt. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doctors, as often as they do conuert the people by the goſpell, from darcknes of vnbelefe, vnto the light: and from the power of Sathan, vnto God, ſo often do they offer an acceptable ſacrifice vnto the Lord. Paul when he conuerted the gentiles, vnto the fayth of Chriſt, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth that his labor, the oblation of the Gentiles,<note place="margin">Rom. 15.16</note> made acceptable, <hi>and ſanctified by the holy ghoſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here we plainely ſee, that the kingdome of Chriſt, is a ſpirituall kingdome, and that it is had vnder the cros. For all they which are in that kingdome, are prieſtes, and offer vp ſacrifice, and therefore it is a prieſtly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which is here in the world proued by affliction. You haue not here any word, or mention, of an earthly dominion, maieſty, or pomp: but you heare mention made of a kingdome, which conſiſteth in ſpirite, and fayth.</p>
                  <p>Iudah, and Ieruſalem, to wit, the Church of Chriſt offer vp in the tyme of Meſſias, an excellent ſacrifice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, ſuch as were the ſacrifices of Abell, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaak, and Iacob, which were offered vp long before that Meſſias had receaued the law, and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and brought to the Iewes.</p>

                  <p>Faith in Chriſt made them acceptable: for the patriarks by fayth looked ſteadfaſtly for the promiſed bleſſings, and grace of God in Meſſias. And they offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp yerely ſacrifice, &amp; honored God, and gaue hym thanks, with lowly, and Chriſtian harts for hys grace promiſed by this faith, as Paul witneſſeth to the Hebr. <hi>Becauſe it is vnpoſsible to pleaſe God without fayth.</hi> And Paul in that chapter reckneth vp alſo thoſe holy Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch, and fathers,<note place="margin">Hebr. 11.6.</note> and ſayth that their works pleaſed the Lord by faith.

And Chriſt in Luke, exhorteth the godly to <hi>lift vp their heads</hi> when the day of the Lord draweth nye,<note place="margin">Luk. 21.28</note> becauſe then their redemption alſo is at hand. Then ſhall that laſt enemy of the godly, to wit, death be deſtroyed, and mor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tality ſhal be ſwallowed vp in the life of Chriſt. Then ſhall they all haue lyberty, and ability to be alwayes with Chriſt, without any impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the body. Now the body is ſlothful, loytering, and weake: but at the laſt day, it ſhal be as cleere as the ſun, immortall, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, ſtrong, puiſſant, liuely, ſuttle, neate, pure, ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and nimble, and haue eternall health. For they are ſaued both in body, and ſoul, as our creed doth teach vs. I beleeue the riſing again of the fleſh, which with the
<pb facs="tcp:16253:236"/>
ſoule muſt be glorifyed, and haue euerlaſting life. The vngodly here in this earth doe miſerably kick, treade vpon, afflict, iniury, and mock the godly, and count the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as ofſcourings of the earth: nay, they iudge them to be moſt wicked men of all, and euen ſacrifices for ſinnes. For the elect ſhall haue tribulation, euen vnto the laſt day: but when Chriſt the ſonne of righteouſnes, ſhall come down from heauen, to ſeperate chaffe from wheat to wit, his ſeruants from the wicked: then ſhall there be an alteration of all things, then ſhal the pompe, bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery, and glory of this world, with all the fooliſh confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence therof, fail, and fall. Then ſhall the wicked be tumbled down from their honor, and be for euer vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ſhamed, and be made our footſtole. Then ſhall they be broaken, and troaden down, and be contemned for euer, and be more filthy, and vile then the durt in the ſtreetes. For he which here ſuffereth with Chriſt, ſhall in the world to come, be glorifyed, and raign w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt for euer: But he which here beleueth not the goſpell in this life, and is not like to Chriſt our head in the croſſe, he at the laſt iudgement ſhall be condemned vnto hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, and euerlaſting death, lamentations, calamities, and miſeries, with all the deuils in hell. And this ſhall the Lord of <hi>Zebooth,</hi> or the Lord of hoſtes doe. He ſhall bring that day vpon the world, when it ſhall liue moſt ſecurely: and vnto his, that is, vnto the Chriſtifideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, he ſhal geue that kingdome of glory, which by the prophets, and euangeliſtes, he hath promiſed them.</p>
                  <p>In the wordes following, he exhorteth the people that they call to mind the law of Moyſes: as if he had ſayd, the time of Meſſias is not far of, it is euen now at hand. Beware, and watch, that ye deſpice not the day of your viſitation, that when the Lord commeth, you be not offended at him.</p>
                  <p>Moyſes hath foretold you in Deuter. that the Lord wil rayſe vp vnto you,<note place="margin">Deut. 18.18</note> 
                     <hi>a prophet of your bretheren, like vnto him,</hi> to Moyſes, that is, one which is true man as Moyſes was, he ſhall teach by the commaundementes of God, and the Lord will puniſh him which will not heare him. For Moyſes ſaith, that <hi>God will require it of</hi> them: that is, they which wil not beleue the goſpell of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:16253:236"/>
Meſſias, ſhal at the laſt day geue account vnto the lord: and for their vnbeleefe, they ſhall be iudged in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lords anger. If the Iewes had obayed this admonition, and more diligently ſought Chriſt in Moyſes, if they had learned better to know his perſon, and office, (ſeeing Moyſes ſpeaketh ſo plainly of Chriſt) then had they not ſo wickedly, and curſedly deſpyſed that day of their viſitation: but would haue imbraced Chriſt, and haue eſteemed him aboue Moyſes. But when Chriſt was come, they would be Moyſes diſcyples, although the terme of his time was ended. For Moyſes was but only a ſeruant in the houſe of the Lord. And when the Lord Chriſt himſelfe came, then ought the ſeruaunt to geue place, and all men ought to heare the word which Chriſt did ſpeak by the word of his father.</p>
                  <p>The righteouſnes of faith had alſo her teſtimonies in the law, in Moyſes, and in the prophets. But when Chriſt, and the Apoſtles taught it, ſaying, <hi>Repent, and beleeue the goſpel,</hi> the Iewes refuſed their doctrine,<note place="margin">Mar. 1.15.</note> and would be iuſtified by Moyſes, and his law, and vſed not the true mediator, and ſauyour Chriſt,<note place="margin">Iewes and Papiſtes in this agree.</note> in the work of their iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but refuſed that moſt precious cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtone, and could not abide to vſe, and admit it in their building of iuſtification. And therfore they became abominable, and periſhed, they, and their building.</p>
                  <p>And leaſt the day of Chriſts former comming, ſhould be vnknown vnto them: he geueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a notable ſigne, wherby they might haue learned, that the day of <hi>Meſſias</hi> was now at hand: for he promiſeth that he would ſend them that former Iohn y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Baptiſt before that great day,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.14.</note> &amp; he <hi>calleth him Elias,</hi> becauſe he ſhould go before Chriſt, and prepare the way for him, in the ſpirite, and ſtrength of <hi>Elias,</hi> as the Angel of the Lord expoundeth this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy of <hi>Elias</hi> to be ment of Iohn y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Baptiſt. And Chriſt himſelf applieth this propheſy in Mathew vnto Iohn Baptiſt ſaying: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Iohn is that <hi>Elias,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 1.24.</note> 
                     <hi>which was to come</hi> that is of whom <hi>Mala.</hi> the laſt prophet did propheſy, Let him which hath eares to heare, heare. But their harts was blinded, &amp; their eares ſtopped vp y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they could not vnderſtand. He calleth that day of Chriſts former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fearfull or horrible beames of the falling away, &amp;

blindnes of the Iewes. For before they were the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloued children of God, and the inheritance of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they killed the true <hi>Meſſas,</hi> the ſon of god, and preferred that wicked offender <hi>Barabas</hi> before him, and wiſhed that his innocent bloud might be vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, and their children: then they were reiected, and blinded, and the kingdome of God was taken from them, and they loſt both the City, and the temple, and the whole land, and they are afflicted as well with ſpirituall, as corporall captiuity vnto this day, and the Gentiles are receaued, and adopted as children.</p>
                  <p>This is that <hi>Heren,</hi> or curſſe wherewith the earth was ſmitten. But they which at the beginning beleued Iohn, and took Chriſt to be their ſauior, and forſaked Moyſes: they eſcaped the curſſe. And ſuch as were the apoſtles, and thoſe of the Iewes which beleeued chriſt and his apoſtles. And theſe in the prophets are called the remnant of Iacob <hi>Malachy,</hi> therfore, (which conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the old teſtament) doth tell vs that Moyſes, with the law, and the prophets, doe all with one conſent beare witnes of Chriſt, that he is the true deliuerer of Iſraell. As if he had ſayd, Moyſes ſerued in the houſe of the Lord, vnto his appointed terme of time was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, propheſying in all his figures, external ſacrifices, oblations, and plaine promiſes of Chriſt, and he refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all his doctrine vnto Chriſt. And this is that ſeede of Abraham, by which all nations are bleſſed. This is that true high prieſt, propiciation, and ſacrifice, which reconcileth vs vnto God.</p>
                  <p>This is that true <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> and that ſerpent in the wildernes, and that great prophet whom Moyſes commaundeth all them to heare, which will not incur the wrath of the Lord. And this is the ſonne of Dauid, to whom the Lord had promiſed an eternal kingdome. Beware therfore, that when he commeth, you take not the ſeruant for the maſter: and a figure, and ſhadow, for the light, and truth. For it is he in deede, of whom the law, and all the prophets with one conſent doe prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye.
